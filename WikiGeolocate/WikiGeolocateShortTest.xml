  <page name="Samtredia">Samtredia ( ) is a town in Imereti, Georgia, lying in a lowland between the rivers Rioni and Tskhenis-Tsqali, west of the capital Tbilisi, and west of Georgia's second largest city Kutaisi. Georgia’s most important roads and railways converge there, making Samtredia the country’s vital transport hub. The Kopitnari Airport is also located in from Samtredia. The town's population is 29,694 as of the 2002 all-Georgia census. The climate is humid subtropical, with mild and warm winters and hot summers.Samtredia evolved from a crucial railway junction in the 1870s and acquired town status in 1921. Under Soviet rule, the local economy diversified from transportation to food and wood production. Due to its strategic location, Samtredia played a prominent role in the civil unrest early in the 1990s when anti-Soviet opposition groups blocked the Samtredia junction from July 26 to 31 1990 in order to force the Soviet Georgian leadership to adopt a liberal election code. The junction was again blocked in March–April 1991, this time by the new government of Zviad Gamsakhurdia, in an attempt to exert pressure on the central Soviet authorities. This blockade, however, inflicted heavy damage not only to the economy of Georgia but to the neighbouring Republic of Armenia, which was largely dependent on Georgia’s railways. In 1993, Samtredia became one of the major battlegrounds in the Georgian Civil War in which the forces loyal to the ousted President Gamsakhurdia confronted the post-coup government troops, and briefly controlled the town from October 17 to October 23, 1993, putting all communications to Tbilisi under threat. Although Samtredia has been stable ever since, the post-Soviet crisis resulted in a significant economic decline that have since only been partially reversed.

  <page name="Amphitheatrum Castrense">The Amphitheatrum Castrense is a Roman amphitheatre in Rome, next to the church of Santa Croce in Gerusalemme. It is the third ancient amphitheatre of Rome after the Colosseum and the Theater of Marcellus. Both the Amphiteatrum and the Circus Varianus were part of the palatial villa known as the Sessorium. The Regionary Catalogues name it as the "Amphitheatrum Castrense" which could mean it was an amphiteathre connected to an imperial residence, which was not uncommon.The amphitheatre is dated to the first decades of the 3rd century AD by the style of the bricks and the absence of brick stamps. It was part of an Imperial villa complex which was built by emperors of the Severan dynasty. The open arches of the outer walls were walled up when the building was incorporated into the Aurelian Walls (271-275 AD), at which point it stopped being used for spectacles and began to be used as fortification, and the ground level around the building was lowered. In the middle of the 16th century the remains of the second story were demolished for defensive needs. In the 18th century, a Hypogeum was found beneath the arena, filled with the bones of large animals. This leads researchers to believe that the spectacles here included Venationes, the hunting and killing of wild animals. Palladio and Étienne Dupérac made drawings about the ruins.The building is a regular ellipse 88 meters long and 75.80 meters wide. It is constructed out of brick-faced concrete, with a few decorative elements in travertine. The structure was three stories high but only a section of the lowest story is preserved.

After this, only small guns were mounted on the fort. It was closed to military use in 1957.The fort is in private ownership of harbour developmentsand has been converted into private flats. There is no public access, not even to the cliff tops which overlook it. It is most easily viewed from the sea, or from Hurst Castle.

By the time it was recognised as part of Sweden (1658), the river running through the town, on which some transportation of goods took place, was almost completely overgrown and despite pleas to restore its function, this did not occur. Some trade still took place from the coast, but the town's significance as a place of naval commerce lessened over the centuries. Today, it is the home of over 2,000 businesses, and the river is still running through it.A devastating fire in 1846 destroyed the town centre, sparing only a little red wooden cabin which is still standing today. In late 2006 and early 2014 other fires affected the town centre, and construction works are currently ongoing to restore the loss of wooden buildings.The town remained small until the 1960s. The municipal reform of 1971 made it the seat of the much larger Kungsbacka Municipality. The town began to grow as a part of Metropolitan Gothenburg. It is the southern terminus of the Gothenburg commuter rail system, situated 28 km from central Gothenburg.The following cities are twinned with Kungsbacka:The following sports clubs are located in Kungsbacka:

  <page name="Hagfors">Hagfors is a locality and the seat of Hagfors Municipality, Värmland County, Sweden with 10,125 inhabitants in 2010.Its history is traced to 1873, when it was decided to build two blast furnaces at the location.The town of Hagfors plays host to the Swedish Rally, a car rally, every February, which provides a significant annual economic windfall for the region.Hagfors was one of the last places in Sweden to receive the formal title of a city, when it was detached from "Norra Råda" in 1950. The designated coat of arms was a tribute to the furnaces. At that time the town had 6,501 inhabitants. Today it is the seat of the much larger Hagfors Municipality, but is not an administrative entity of its own.The Hagfors area has a subarctic climate due to the area's cool nights. The official weather station is located in Gustavsfors, a rural locality to the north at a similar altitude. The climate type is very unusual for subarctic climate since summer days are warm in combination with winter average highs being just below freezing with lows only being around . Cold extremes are frequent for such a southerly area, with an all-time low of being unique for a Swedish area just north of 60 degrees latitude. It being a subarctic climate is a result of the low September night temperatures. Given that Gustavsfors is located somewhat north and Hagfors being a little bit more urban, it is quite possible that the locality just reaches the continental threshold that would require September mean temperatures. In terms of the official reference period of 1961-1990 however, the area is firmly subarctic.Hagfors Airport is located at the town's border. There are flights with Nextjet to Stockholm Arlanda and Torsby.

Vaxholm Municipality prefers to use the designation "Vaxholms stad" (City of Vaxholm) for its whole territory, including 64 islets in the Stockholm archipelago, a usage which is somehow confusing.The town of Vaxholm was established in 1558, when King Gustav Vasa bought some farms from Count Per Brahe the Elder. It later received rights as a merchant town ("köping") and in 1652 was granted the Royal Charter. The designated coat of arms reminds of the fortifications as well as shipping industry.During the 19th century, it hardly expanded.

Settling in this corner the noble family established several rich estates and concentrated their activities in the region. This auspicious plutocracy helped to establish the first roadways into the area, inaugurated in 1882. In 1859, the central government decided to extinguish the parish of Paradinha and incorporate the lands into Moimenta da Beira. It was the Morais Sarmento clan that protested this decision and forced the government to rethink the decision, allowing the civil parish to exist at the municipal reforms.

  <page name="North Fork Toutle River">The North Fork Toutle River is a tributary of the Toutle River in southwestern Washington in the United States. The river has its headwaters near Spirit Lake, on the north side of Mount St. Helens, and flows to the Toutle River, about upstream of its confluence with the Cowlitz River. The largest tributary is the Green River, which joins near the unincorporated town of Toutle.The North Fork's watershed was severely affected by the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens, which coated the valley with ash and filled it with successive mudflows. The result of the eruption was that many hillsides were stripped of forest, and as a result erosion has increased dramatically and the North Fork is now extremely laden with sediment. Previously, Spirit Lake was the source of the river, but eruptions blocked the outlet and Spirit Lake no longer drains directly into the North Fork; instead, a tunnel was excavated in 1985 to connect the lake with South Coldwater Creek, a tributary of the North Fork. Once a mature river, the North Fork has transformed into a braided stream of relatively young origin, and its valley floor is less than three decades old. The Toutle River Sediment Retention Structure was built by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on the river in 1989 to prevent this sediment from traveling downstream and clogging the shipping channel of the Columbia River.The upper part of the North Fork Toutle River watershed was redirected to the crater of Mount St. Helens itself until 1982. The river's headstreams begin on a volcanic ash deposit roughly long and deep, which is the source of much of the excess sediment.

Humphreys, a U.S. Army officer who was a Union general during the American Civil War, and who later became Chief of Engineers of the United States Army Corps of Engineers. However, a General Land Office map from 1903 showed the name "San Francisco Peak" applied to this feature (apparently borrowed from San Francisco Mountain on which the peak stands). Thus the United States Board on Geographic Names approved the variant name in 1911. In 1933, the application of the names was rectified.

By March 1944, there were 11,878 inmates in the camp and its subsidiaries, 6,182 males and 5,696 females, of whom only 95 were gentiles.Unlike Auschwitz or Treblinka, Kaiserwald was not an extermination camp, and the inmates were put to work by large German companies, notably Allgemeine Elektrizitäts-Gesellschaft, which used a large number of female slaves from Kaiserwald in the production of electrical goods, such as batteries.On August 6, 1944, as the Red Army advanced westwards and entered Latvia, the Germans began to evacuate the inmates of Kaiserwald to Stutthof, in Poland. Those who were not thought to be able to survive the trip from Latvia to Poland were shot.All Jews in Kaiserwald who had ever been convicted of any offense, no matter how minor, were executed just prior to the evacuation, as were all Jews under 18 or over 30. By September 1944, all the inmates of Kaiserwald had been moved to Stutthof.The Red Army took over the camp on October 13, 1944 and later used it as a camp for prisoners of war.

Formerly an unincorporated community in the geographic township of Dill, Wanup was annexed into Greater Sudbury on January 1, 2001 when that city was created by amalgamating the former Regional Municipality of Sudbury.The community is located along Highway 537, near the interchange with Highway 69. The smaller neighbourhood of St. Cloud, which is treated as part of Wanup for postal delivery and telephone exchange purposes, is located a few kilometres north of Wanup in the former geographic township of Cleland.Settlement of Wanup dates back to the early 1900s, when large numbers of Finns arrived in Canada. Leaving their homeland to escape the political instability of the time and the spectre of war with Russia many Finns chose this area to resume their primarily agricultural lifestyles. This area was popular among the Finns due to the geographical similarities with many parts of Finland. Another important factor was the abundance of available work from the construction of the CN and CP rail lines which pass through the area. Wanup has acted as base for many generations of Finnish Canadians and still retains a high number of Finnish families.On June 2, 2013, a rail bridge crossing the Wanapitei River at Wanup collapsed, causing a train derailment.

  <page name="Ras Dashen">Ras Dejen (alternatively Ras Dashan Ge'ez ራስ ደጀን "rās dejen" or ራስ ዳሸን "rās dashen", Amharic "head guard") is the highest mountain in Ethiopia and tenth highest mountain of Africa. Part of Simien Mountains National Park located in the Gondar, Amhara Region, it reaches an elevation of 4,550 metres (14,928 ft). The more common form, "Ras Dashen" is a corruption of its Amharic name, "Ras Dejen", used by the system of the Ethiopian Mapping Authority (EMA) which means "the general who fights in front of the Emperor".According to Erik Nilsson, Ras Dejen is the eastern peak of the rim of "an enormous volcano, the northern half of which is cut down about [a] thousand metres by numerous ravines, draining into the Takkazzi River." Its western counterpart is Mount Biuat (4,510 meters), separated by the valley of the Meshaha river. The mountain is often place to violent snowfalls during the night, but, since daily and night temperatures vary greatly, the snow is almost completely melted in a few hours (during the hottest period of the year) since temperature may be over 5 Celsius degrees by midday. In winter snow falls rarely, since the majority of yearly rainfalls in Ethiopia are in the summer, but if it does it usually lasts for weeks or months.The first recorded ascent by a Eurasian was in 1841, by the French officers Ferret and Galinier. There is no verifiable evidence of earlier ascents by locals, but the summit climate and conditions are relatively hospitable, and there are nearby high altitude pastoral settlements.

  <page name="Mount Foraker">Mount Foraker is a mountain in the central Alaska Range, in Denali National Park, southwest of Denali. It is the second highest peak in the Alaska Range, and the third highest peak in the United States. It rises almost directly above the standard base camp for Denali, on a fork of the Kahiltna Glacier also near Mount Hunter in the Alaska Range.Its north peak was first climbed on August 6, 1934, and its higher south peak was climbed four days later on August 10, by Charles Houston, T. Graham Brown, and Chychele Waterston, via the west ridge.Mount Foraker was named in 1899 by Lt. J. S. Herron after Joseph B. Foraker, then a sitting U.S. Senator from Ohio.The mountain, along with Denali, was called "Bolshaya Gora" ("big mountain") in Russian. The Tanaina Indians of the Susitna River valley and Tanana Indians to the north are reported to have had the same name (Denali) for Mt. Foraker as they had for Denali (previously Mount McKinley), and it appears that the names were not applied to individual peaks but instead to the Denali massif. The Tanana Indians in the Lake Minchumina area, however, had a broadside view of the mountains and thus gave distinctive names to each. According to Hudson Stuck, these Indians had two names for Mount Foraker: "Sultana" meaning "the woman" and "Menlale" meaning "Denali's wife".

The rounded summits of the Galtees were formed due to the higher parts of the Galtees being above the ice. The constant freeze-thaw action on the higher rocks gradually wore these down to form the stony, scree-covered summits we have today. Glacial action also formed cirques on the higher slopes, which are now occupied by five corrie lakes.
