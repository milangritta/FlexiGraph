Abano Terme's population is 19,062 (2001) (in 1901 it was only 4,556).The town's hot springs and mud baths are the main economic resource. The waters have a temperature of someThe baths were known to the Romans as "Aponi fons" or "Aquae Patavinae". A description of them is given in a letter to Theodoric, the king of the Ostrogoths, from Cassiodorus. Some remains of the ancient baths have been discovered (S. Mandruzzato, "Trattato dei Bagni d'Abano," Padua, 1789). An oracle of Geryon lay near, and the so-called "sortes Praenestinae" (C.I.L. i., Berlin, 1863; 1438–1454), small bronze cylinders inscribed, and used as oracles, were perhaps found here in the 16th century.The baths were destroyed by the Lombards in the 6th century, but they were rebuilt and enlarged when Abano became an autonomous comune in the 12th century and, again, in the late 14th century. The city was under the Republic of Venice from 1405 to 1797.Just outside the city is San Daniele Abbey (11th century). 6 km from the city is also Praglia Abbey, founded in the 11th century by Benedictine monks and rebuilt in 1496–1550. The abbey church of the Assumption, with a marble portal from 1548, has a Renaissance style interior. Noteworthy is the four cloister complex.

  <page name="Agra Canal">The Agra Canal is an important Indian irrigation work which starts from Okhla in Delhi. The Agra canal originates from Okhla barrage, downstream of Nizamuddin bridge. It opened in 1874.In the beginning, it was available for navigation, in Delhi, erstwhile Gurgaon, Mathura and Agra Districts, and Bharatpur State. Later, navigation was stopped in 1904 and the canal has since then, been exclusively used for irrigation purposes only. At present the canal does not flow in district Gurgaon, but only in Faridabad, which was earlier a part of Gurgaon.The Canal receives its water from the Yamuna River at Okhla, about 10 km to the south of New Delhi. The weir across the Yamuna was the first attempted in Upper India upon a foundation of fine sand; it is about 800-yard long, and rises seven-feet above the summer level of the river.From Okhla the canal follows the high land between the Khari-Nadi and the Yamuna and finally joins the Banganga river about below Agra. Navigable branches connect the canal with Mathura and Agra.the canal irrigates about 1.5 lakh hectares in Agra, and Mathura in Uttar Pradesh, Faridabad in Haryana, Bharatpur in Rajasthan and also some parts of DelhiThe Agra Canal also has many places to visit along its coast.

  <page name="Arno">The Arno is a river in the Tuscany region of Italy. It is the most important river of central Italy after the Tiber.The river originates on Mount Falterona in the Casentino area of the Apennines, and initially takes a southward curve. The river turns to the west near Arezzo passing through Florence, Empoli and Pisa, flowing into the Tyrrhenian Sea at Marina di Pisa.With a length of , it is the largest river in the region. It has many tributaries: Sieve at long, Bisenzio at , and the Era, Elsa, Pesa, and Pescia. The drainage basin amounts to more than and drains the waters of the following subbasins:It crosses Florence, where it passes below the Ponte Vecchio and the Santa Trìnita bridge (built by Bartolomeo Ammanati but inspired by Michelangelo). The river flooded this city regularly in historical times, most recently in 1966, with after rainfall of in Badia Agnano and in Florence, in only 24 hours.The flow rate of the Arno is irregular. It is sometimes described as having a torrentlike behaviour, because it can easily go from almost dry to near flood in a few days. At the point where the Arno leaves the Apennines, flow measurements can vary between . New dams built upstream of Florence have greatly alleviated the problem in recent years.The flood on November 4, 1966 collapsed the embankment in Florence, killing at least 40 people and damaging or destroying millions of works of art and rare books. New conservation techniques were inspired by the disaster, but even decades later hundreds of works still await restoration.From Latin "Arnus" (Pliny, "Natural History" 3.50). The philologist Hans Krahe related this toponym on a paleo-European basis "*Ar-n-", derived from the Proto-Indo-European root *"er-", "flow, move".

  <page name="Camp David">Camp David is the country retreat of the President of the United States. It is located in wooded hills of Catoctin Mountain Park near Thurmont, Maryland, about 62 miles (100 km) north-northwest of Washington, D.C.. It is officially known as the Naval Support Facility Thurmont, because it is technically a military installation, and staffing is primarily provided by the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Marine Corps.Originally known as Hi-Catoctin, Camp David was built as a camp for federal government agents and their families by the WPA. Construction started in 1935 and was completed in 1938. In 1942, Franklin D. Roosevelt converted it to a presidential retreat and renamed it "Shangri-La" (for the fictional Himalayan paradise in the 1933 novel "Lost Horizon" by British author James Hilton). Camp David received its present name from Dwight D. Eisenhower, in honor of his father and grandson, both named David.The Catoctin Mountain Park does not indicate the location of Camp David on park maps due to privacy and security concerns.Since it was built, every president up to and including Barack Obama has made use of the retreat.On July 2, 2011, an F-15 intercepted a small two-seat passenger plane flying near Camp David, when President Obama was in residence. The civilian aircraft, which was out of radio communication, was intercepted approximately from the presidential retreat. The F-15 escorted the aircraft out of the area, and it landed in nearby Hagerstown, Maryland, without incident. The civilian plane's occupants were flying between two Maryland towns and were released without charge.On July 10, 2011, an F-15 intercepted another small two-seat passenger plane flying near Camp David when President Barack Obama was again in residence; a total of three planes were intercepted over that July 9 weekend.

The municipality had a population of 132,011 on January 1, 2013, and the population is increasing with roughly 1500 people annually.Between 1912 and 1971 the name of the town was officially spelled Hälsingborg (rather like the region of Hälsingland but unlike neighbouring Danish Helsingør and the Finnish capital Helsingfors (Helsinki)). The spelling was changed back to the older version when the present municipality was created in 1971 through the amalgamation of the "Town of Hälsingborg" with four surrounding rural municipalities. Since the 1990s the municipality again styles itself "Helsingborgs stad" ("Town of Helsingborg"). This usage is only nominal and has no effect on the status of the municipality.There are 15 urban areas (also called a Tätort or locality) in Helsingborg Municipality.

  <page name="Hamoaze">The Hamoaze (; ) is an estuarine stretch of the tidal River Tamar, between its confluence with the River Lynher and Plymouth Sound, England.The name first appears as "ryver of Hamose" in 1588 and it originally most likely applied just to a creek of the estuary that led up to the manor of Ham, north of the present-day Devonport Dockyard. The name evidently later came to be used for the estuary's main channel. The "ose" element possibly derives from Old English "wāse" meaning 'mud' (as in 'ooze') – the creek consisting of mud-banks at low tide – although this is not confirmed.The Hamoaze flows past Devonport Dockyard, which is one of three major bases of the Royal Navy today. The presence of large numbers of small watercraft are a challenge and hazard to the warships using the naval base and dockyard. Navigation on the waterway is controlled by the Queen's Harbour Master for Plymouth.Settlements on the banks of the Hamoaze are Saltash, Wilcove, Torpoint and Cremyll in Cornwall, as well as Devonport and Plymouth in Devon.Two regular ferry services crossing the Hamoaze exist: the Torpoint Ferry (a chain ferry that takes vehicles) and the Cremyll Ferry (passengers and cyclists only).

  <page name="Lake Abitibi">Lake Abitibi () is a lake in northeastern Ontario and western Quebec, Canada. The lake, which lies within the vast Clay Belt, is separated in two distinct portions by a short narrows, making it actually 2 lakes. Its total area is 931 km², and net area 903 km². The lake is shallow and studded with islands. Its shores and vicinity are covered with small timber.Its outlet is the Abitibi River, a tributary the Moose River, which empties into James Bay. The lake takes its name from the river. "Abitibi" comes from the Algonquin words "abitah", meaning middle and "nipi" meaning water, possibly a reference to its geographic location between the Harricana (from the Algonquin word "Nanikana", meaning "the main way") to the east and the Kapuskasing–Mattagami river system to the west.Application of "Abitibi" to describe the lake and the people living in the area around it was first noted in The Jesuit Relations in 1640. One of the first Europeans in this area was Pierre de Troyes, who built a post on Lake Abitibi when he was on his way to capture English HBC posts on James Bay in 1686. The Abitibi Post lay halfway between trading posts on James Bay and those on the Ottawa River.It was formerly used by the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) as part of a canoe route to the fur lands of the north. A HBC trading post was located on the east shore of the lake in Ontario. The construction of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway (now Canadian National Railway) through this district made it of some importance at the start of the 20th century.Portions of Lake Abitibi's western shores and a section of the Abitibi River are part of the Abitibi-de-Troyes Provincial Park.

  <page name="Morona">The Morona is a tributary to the Amazon River, and flows parallel to the Pastaza River and immediately to the west of it, and is the last stream of any importance on the northern side of the Amazon before reaching the Pongo de Manseriche.It is formed from a multitude of water-courses which descend the slopes of the Ecuadorian Andes south of the gigantic volcano of Sangay; but it soon reaches the plain, which commences where it receives its Cusulima branch. The Morona is navigable for small craft for about 300 miles above its mouth, but it is extremely tortuous. Canoes may ascend many of its branches, especially the Cusuhma and the Miazal, the latter almost to the base of Sangay. The Morona has been the scene of many rude explorations, with the hope of finding it serviceable as a commercial route between the inter-Andean tableland of Ecuador and the Amazon river.

  <page name="Mayerling">Mayerling is a small village (pop: 200) in Lower Austria belonging to the municipality of Alland in the district of Baden. It is situated on the Schwechat River, in the Wienerwald ("Vienna woods"), 15 miles (24 km) southwest of Vienna. From 1550, it was in the possession of the abbey of Heiligenkreuz.In 1886 Crown Prince Rudolf of Austria, only son of Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria and Empress Elisabeth of Bavaria and heir to the Austro-Hungarian crown, acquired the manor and transformed it into a hunting lodge. It was in this hunting lodge that, on January 30, 1889, he was found dead with his mistress Baroness Mary Vetsera, apparently as a result of suicide. Exactly what happened is unknown but on 31 July 2015 the Austrian National Library issued copies of Vetsera's letters of farewell to her mother and other family members. The letters - written in Mayerling shortly before the deaths - state clearly and unambiguously that Vetsera was preparing to commit suicide alongside Rudolf, out of "love".After the deaths of Prince Rudolf and Baroness Vetsera, the Emperor Franz Joseph, who wanted to found a new church, had the building turned into a convent which was settled by nuns of the Discalced Carmelite Order. Visitors may view the statue of the Madonna in the Lady Chapel of the church. It has the face of the Empress Elisabeth and has a dagger in the Immaculate Heart. The position of the main cross in the chapel is supposed to be where the bed of Rudolf and his lover Mary Vetsera was situated.Today the lodge is a museum and tourist attraction in Austria. Prayers are still said daily by the nuns for the repose of the soul of Crown Prince Rudolf.

They are collectively referred to as the Ionian Islands, the major ones being Corfu, Zakynthos, Kephalonia, Ithaca, and Lefkada.There are ferry routes between Patras and Igoumenitsa, Greece, and Brindisi and Ancona, Italy, that cross the east and north of the Ionian Sea, and from Piraeus westward. Calypso Deep, the deepest point in the Mediterranean at , is located in the Ionian Sea, at . The sea is one of the most seismically active areas in the world.The name "Ionian" comes from the Greek language . Its etymology is unknown. Ancient Greek writers, especially Aeschylus, linked it to the myth of Io. In Ancient Greek the adjective "Ionios" () was used as an epithet for the sea because Io swam across it. According to the "Oxford Classical Dictionary", the name may derive from Ionians who sailed to the West. There were also narratives about other eponymic legendary figures; according to one version, "Ionius" was a son of "Adrias" (eponymic for the Adriatic Sea); according to another, "Ionius" was a son of "Dyrrhachus". When Dyrrhachus was attacked by his own brothers, Heracles, who was passing through the area, came to his aid, but in the fight the hero killed his ally's son by mistake. The corpse was cast into the sea, which thereafter was called the Ionian Sea.The International Hydrographic Organization defines the limits of the Ionian Sea as follows:From south to north in the west, then north to south in the east:

  <page name="La Caletta">La Caletta is a small town, a harbour and a tourist destination in Sardinia, Italy. Caletta means a small bay or little harbour.The town is located approximately 50 km south of Olbia, in the administrative territory of Siniscola (province of Nuoro), on the Tyrrhenian coast of the island.An ancient village of fishermen, its small gulf has been transformed in the 1970s into a touristic harbour, and recently renewed and enlarged. The town (est. 1,000 inhabitants, that become more than 10,000 in Summer) is today deeply dependent on tourism and borders, at its northern side, with San Giovanni, the coastal fraction of Posada.La Caletta is in front of a well known beach (appr. 10 km of pure white sand) that ends at the small town of Santa Lucia.Local population requires that La Caletta can have in its port a ferry line for "the Continent" (Italian mainland), and some experiments were practiced a few years ago, that confirmed the potential success of such an eventual initiative, but (also due to the particular administrative competence of an external organ and being part of the port under the authority of the bordering territory of Posada) administrative problems and local rivalries actually stop any further evolution in this sense.

  <page name="Alberobello">Alberobello (; literally "beautiful tree") is a small town and "comune" of the Metropolitan City of Bari, Apulia, southern Italy. It has about 10,700 inhabitants and is famous for its unique "trulli" buildings. The "Trulli" of Alberobello have been designated as a UNESCO World Heritage site since 1996.Alberobello was first mentioned in the early 16th century when the first 40 families were granted land to farm in the area.The abundance of calcareous sedimentary material in the area lead to the building of houses with dry stone without the use of mortar. These houses were the first "trulli" which contributed to the expansion of the settlement. Building the houses of dry stone was a requirement of Count Giangirolamo II as in this way it was avoidable to pay taxes on them.The inhabitants of Alberobello were feudal vassals of the Acquaviva of Aragon until May 27, 1797, when King Ferdinand IV of Bourbon received Alberobello and issued a decree that elevated the small village to a royal city, freeing them from feudal serfdom.Alberobello is twinned with:&lt;BR&gt;

  <page name="Bay of Pigs">The Bay of Pigs (Spanish: "Bahía de Cochinos") is an inlet of the Gulf of Cazones located on the southern coast of Cuba. By 1910, it was included in Santa Clara Province, and then instead to Las Villas Province by 1961, but in 1976, it was reassigned to Matanzas Province, when the original six provinces of Cuba were re-organized into 14 new Provinces of Cuba.This bay is approximately 30 kilometers South of Jagüey Grande, 70 kilometers west of the city of Cienfuegos, and 150 kilometers southeast from the capital city Havana. On the western side of the bay, coral reefs border the main Zapata Swamp, part of the Zapata Peninsula. On the eastern side, beaches border margins of firm ground with mangroves and extensive areas of swampland to the north and east. At the north end of the bay, the village of Buena Ventura is adjacent to Playa Larga (Long Beach). 35 kilometers southeast of that, Playa Girón (Giron Beach) at the village of Girón, named after the notorious French pirate Gilberto Giron (c. 1604).Playa Girón and Playa Larga were the landing sites for seaborne forces of armed Cuban exiles in the Bay of Pigs Invasion, an American CIA-sponsored attempt to overthrow the new government of Cuban Prime Minister Fidel Castro in April 1961.According to Fidel Castro's former bodyguard, the late Juan Reinaldo Sánchez, Castro lived in great luxury and had a private island in the Bay of Pigs, replete with "mansions, guest houses, a heliport, dolphinarium, turtle lagoon, his luxury yacht "Aquarama" – a gift from Leonid Brezhnev – and deep-sea fishing speedboat".In Cuban Spanish, "cochinos" may also mean the queen triggerfish ("Balistes vetula"), which inhabits coral reefs in Bahía de Cochinos, not swine ("Sus scrofa").

  <page name="La Pérouse Strait">La Pérouse Strait, or Sōya Strait, is a strait dividing the southern part of the Russian island of Sakhalin (Karafuto) from the northern part of the Japanese island of Hokkaidō, and connecting the Sea of Japan on the west with the Sea of Okhotsk on the east.The strait is long and deep. The narrowest part of the strait is in the west between Russia's Cape Krillion and Japan's Cape Soya, which is also the shallowest at only 60 meters deep. A small rocky island, appropriately named Kamen Opasnosti (Russian for "Rock of Danger") is located in the Russian waters in the northeastern part of the strait, 8 miles southeast of the Cape Krillion. Another small island, Bentenjima, lies near the Japanese shore of the strait.The strait is named after Jean-François de Galaup, comte de Lapérouse, who explored the channel in 1787.Japan's territorial waters extend to three nautical miles into La Pérouse Strait instead of the usual twelve, reportedly to allow nuclear-armed United States Navy warships and submarines to transit the strait without violating Japan's prohibition against nuclear weapons in its territory.Between 1848 and 1892, American whaleships passed through the strait in the spring and summer as they made their way from the right whale grounds in the Sea of Japan to the Sea of Okhotsk to hunt right and bowhead whales. The ship "David Paddack" (352 tons), Captain Swain, of Nantucket, was bound home with a full cargo when she wrecked in the strait in 1848.

Its width varies from at its largest point, to a minimum of .The entrance to Hudson Strait was discovered in 1578 by Sir Martin Frobisher, the English navigator, who named a tidal rip at the entrance the Furious Overfall, and called the strait Mistaken Strait, since he felt it held less promise as an entrance to the Northwest Passage than the body of water that was later named Frobisher Bay. The name was changed to Hudson Strait in honor of the first European to sail beyond the Furious Overfall in 1610: English explorer Henry Hudson in the English ship "Discovery". Hudson was followed by Thomas Button in 1612, and a more detailed mapping expedition led by William Baffin in 1615.Hudson Strait links the northern seaports of Manitoba and Ontario with the Atlantic Ocean. It could be an eastern entrance to the Northwest Passage were it not for ice in the Fury and Hecla Strait south of western Baffin Island.The International Hydrographic Organization defines the limits of the Hudson Strait as follows:

It is also the birthplace of Narcís Monturiol, inventor of the first successful machine-powered submarine. Also born here was Mónica Naranjo, one of the best selling Spanish singers of the 1990s and 2000s.The town's name derives from that of Ficaris, of Visigoth origins. In 1267, King James I of Aragon conceded it fuero rights, but four years later count Ponç IV of Empúries set the town on fire.During the Spanish Civil War, it remained loyal to the Republican government, and was repeatedly bombed by the rebels. Figueres recovered starting from the 1950s, consolidating its economy around the tourism industry.Situated in the north-east corner of Catalonia, Figueres is about from Girona, from Barcelona, from Perpignan, and from Girona-Costa Brava Airport. It is also served by its own railway station just east of the old town center.Figueres has been connected since December 2010 to the high-speed rail network with the start of services connecting Figueres to Perpignan via LGV, allowing direct TGV services to Paris in 5 h 27 min.

  <page name="Bridalveil Fall">Bridalveil Fall is one of the most prominent waterfalls in the Yosemite Valley in California, seen yearly by millions of visitors to Yosemite National Park.The waterfall is in height and flows year round.The Ahwahneechee tribe believed that Bridalveil Fall was home to a vengeful spirit named Pohono who guarded the entrance to the valley and that those leaving the valley must not look directly into the waterfall lest they be cursed. They also believed that inhaling the mist of Bridalveil Fall would improve one's chances of marriage.The glaciers that carved Yosemite Valley left many hanging valleys that spawned the waterfalls that pour into the valley. All of the waterways that fed these falls carved the hanging valleys into steep cascades with the exception of Bridalveil Fall. Bridalveil Creek still leaps into the valley from the edge of the precipice, although that edge has moved back into an alcove from the original edge of the valley. While Yosemite Falls seem to also fall into this category, the original course took the Yosemite Creek down a gorge to the west of its current location. The primary source of Bridalveil Falls is Ostrander Lake, some to the south.In a brisk wind, the falling water is often blown sideways, and when the flow is light, it may not reach the ground directly below. Because of this, the Ahwahneechee Native Americans called this waterfall ""Pohono"", which means "Spirit of the Puffing Wind".

  <page name="Montmartre Cemetery">Montmartre Cemetery () is a cemetery in the 18th arrondissement of Paris, France, that dates to the early 19th century. Officially known as the Cimitière du Nord, it is the third largest necropolis in Paris, after the Père Lachaise cemetery and the Montparnasse cemetery.In the mid-18th century, overcrowding in the cemeteries of Paris had created numerous problems, from impossibly high funeral costs to unsanitary living conditions in the surrounding neighborhoods. In the 1780s, the Cimetière des Innocents was officially closed and citizens were banned from burying corpses within the city limits of Paris. During the early 19th century, new cemeteries were constructed outside the precincts of the capital: Montmartre in the north, Père Lachaise Cemetery in the east, Passy Cemetery in the west and Montparnasse Cemetery in the south.The Montmartre Cemetery was opened on January 1, 1825. It was initially known as la Cimetière des Grandes Carrières (Cemetery of the Large Quarries). The name referenced the cemetery's unique location, in an abandoned gypsum quarry. The quarry had previously been used during the French Revolution as a mass grave. It was built below street level, in the hollow of an abandoned gypsum quarry located west of the "Butte" near the beginning of Rue Caulaincourt in "Place de Clichy." As is still the case today, its sole entrance was constructed on Avenue Rachel under Rue Caulaincourt.A popular tourist destination even today, Montmartre Cemetery is the final resting place of many famous artists who lived and worked in the Montmartre area.

  <page name="Flix">Flix (, ) is a town in the "comarca" of Ribera d'Ebre, Catalonia, Spain. Situated on a promontory by the Ebro river, the town occupied an important strategic position. Situated on the Madrid–Barcelona railway line, it expanded in the early twentieth century with the construction of a hydroelectric power station and a large chemical plant, "Electroquímica de Flix".There is excellent fishing in the horseshoe-shaped bend in the river (day ticket). Every year there is a large international fishing competition at Flix.Flix was the site of a battle in the Spanish Civil War in 1938. The Battle of the Iron Bridge was fought between the International Brigades and the Fascists as part of the Battle of the Ebro. The operation was initially a success for the republicans with the construction of the iron bridge nearly complete by the 3rd Division. However at the end they had lost 3,000 soldiers and the battle. Today there is a memorial to this battle at Flix.In 2005 the existence of a vast polluted area on the shores of the Flix Reservoir was disclosed. The environmental disaster involving large quantities of toxic waste was caused by the Ercros chemical factory, located by the shore of the artificial lake. Following this disclosure an ambitious plan to clean up the area has been drawn. This plan involves the building of containment barriers and the removal and treatment of the hazardous chemical waste.The population of Flix has grown since 1900 and peaked in the 1980s.

  <page name="Chafarinas Islands">The Chafarinas Islands ( , Berber: "Igumamen Iceffaren" or "Takfarinas", Arabic: جزر الشفارين or الجزر الجعفرية), also spelled Zafarin, Djaferin or Zafarani, are a group of three small islets located in the Alboran Sea off the coast of Morocco with an aggregate area of , to the east of Nador and off the Moroccan town of Ras Kebdana.The Chafarinas Islands are one of the Spanish territories on North Africa off the Moroccan coast known as "plazas de soberanía".These offshore islands were uninhabited and unclaimed at the time the French government decided in 1848 to occupy them in order to monitor the unruly tribes living in the border area between Morocco and French Algeria. A small expedition under the command of Colonel MacMahon (the future Marshal MacMahon) left Oran by sea and by land in January 1848 to take possession of the islands. Forewarned by its consul in Oran, Spain, which also coveted the Chafarinas, quickly dispatched a warship to the islands from Malaga. When the French arrived, the Spaniards had already taken possession of the islands in the name of Queen Isabel II.The Chafarinas Islands are made up of three islands (from west to east, with areas in hectares):Under Spanish control since 1847, there is a 190-man military garrison on Isla Isabel II, the only stable population on the small archipelago, down from 426 people in 1900 and 736 people in 1910.The islands had a certain relevance in Spanish environmentalist circles during the 1980s and 1990s as the very last individual of Mediterranean monk seal in Spanish territory lived there, until it disappeared in the 1990s. Nine out of eleven marine invertebrates considered endangered species and the second largest colony in the world of the endangered Audouin's gull inhabit the islands.

  <page name="Tasman Sea">The Tasman Sea (Māori: "Te Tai-o-Rehua") is a marginal sea of the South Pacific Ocean, situated between Australia and New Zealand. It measures about across and about from north to south. The sea was named after the Dutch explorer Abel Janszoon Tasman, who was the first recorded European to encounter New Zealand and Tasmania. The British explorer Captain James Cook later extensively navigated the Tasman Sea in the 1770s as part of his first voyage of exploration.The Tasman Sea is informally referred to in both Australian and New Zealand English as The Ditch; for example, "crossing the Ditch" means travelling to Australia from New Zealand, or vice versa. The diminutive term "The Ditch" used for the Tasman Sea is comparable to referring to the North Atlantic Ocean as "The Pond".The International Hydrographic Organization defines the limits of the Tasman Sea as follows:The Tasman Sea's mid-ocean ridge developed between 85 and 55 million years ago as Australia and Zealandia broke apart during the breakup of supercontinent Gondwana. It lies roughly midway between the continental margins of Australia and Zealandia. Much of Zealandia is submerged, so the ridge runs much closer to the Australian coast than New Zealand's.The Tasman Sea features a number of mid-sea island groups, quite apart from coastal islands located near the Australian and New Zealand mainlands:Moncrieff and Hood were the first to attempt to a Trans-Tasman crossing by plane in 1928. The first successful flight over the sea was accomplished by Charles Kingsford Smith later that year. The first person to row solo across the sea was Colin Quincey in 1977. The next successful solo crossing was completed by his son, Shaun Quincey in 2010.

  <page name="Cumberland Falls">Cumberland Falls, sometimes called the Little Niagara, the Niagara of the South, or the Great Falls, is a large waterfall on the Cumberland River in southeastern Kentucky. Spanning the river at the border of McCreary and Whitley counties, the waterfall is the central feature of Cumberland Falls State Resort Park.On average the falls, which flow over a resistant sandstone bed, are 68 feet (21 m) high and 125 feet (38 m) wide, with an average water flow of 3,600 cubic feet per second (100 m³/s).Under a full moon on clear nights, an elusive lunar rainbow or moonbow is sometimes formed by the mist emanating from the falls.The Moonbow that appears here may be observed under a full moon and a clear sky. An arch of white light is usually produced at base of Falls and continues downstream. Generations of people have visited here to see this natural phenomenon. The last hotel on this site, Moonbow Inn, was named for the moonbow.A historical marker erected was 1987 (Number 1801). Location: 36° 50.296′ N, 84° 20.634′ W.

  <page name="Dos Hermanas">Dos Hermanas is a Spanish city south of Seville in Andalusia, with a population of 131,317 as of 2015.The city's name, which means "two sisters", dates from its founding in 1248 by King Ferdinand III of Castile and honours the sisters of Gonzalo Nazareno, one of the king's principal military commanders. For this reason natives of Dos Hermanas are called "nazarenos/as".The main economic activities of the city today are the production and distribution of olive oil and "Spanish olives", together with a significant number of service industries.At Dos Hermanas, south of Los Palacios ( geographical coordinates: ), there is a powerful broadcasting mediumwave facility with a 232 metre tall guyed mast, used for the transmission of the first program of RNE with 300 kW on 684 kHz. The transmitter, which is most often designated as "RNE-1 Sevilla" can be received easily at night throughout Europe and northern Africa.The members of Spanish lounge music duo Los del Río (known for their international hit single, Macarena) are natives of Dos Hermanas and still reside in the city.Spanish popstar Melody comes from Dos Hermanas. In 2014 a controversy was sparked when an interviewer for Cuatro TV asked her how come she spoke so well 'in spite of coming from Dos Hermanas'. This sparked a large debate on classism and Madrid-centric snobbery.Its football club, Dos Hermanas CF, was founded in 1971. It plays in the Primera Andaluza, the highest league in the region. It has had four spells playing in national leagues, including the third tier, the Segunda B, between 1999 and 2002. It returned to regional football in 2010.

  <page name="Gran Valira">The Gran Valira (, ) is the biggest river in Andorra. It flows through the capital, Andorra la Vella, and exits the country in the south near the Spain–Andorra road border crossing.The Gran Valira is a tributary to the Segre, which in turn is a tributary to the Ebro. It flows into the Segre in La Seu d'Urgell. Its main tributaries are the Valira d'Orient, the Valira del Nord and the Madriu. The Valira river system is long.The map service of the Andorran government calls it the Gran Valira. In certain sources, especially those with a Spanish influence such as maps published in Spain, it is sometimes referred to as the Valira because in the territory of Spain there is only one Valira river. In Andorra, however, there are several different Valiras and hence there is a need to distinguish between them.

  <page name="Achor">Achor (Hebrew עכור "muddy, turbid: gloomy, dejected") is the name of a valley in the vicinity of Jericho.Eusebius (in "Onomasticon") and Jerome (in "Book of Sites and Names of Hebrew Places") implied that they thought it was a valley north of Jericho. In the nineteenth century some writers identified the valley with the wadi al-Qelt, a deep ravine located to Jericho's south. In the twentieth century the Hyrcania valley (El-Buqei'a in Arabic) west and south of Qumran, and Wadi en-Nu'eima have also been suggested. One difficulty is that the narrative of Joshua appears to place the valley of Achor to the north of Jericho, between Jericho and Ai; but Joshua makes the valley part of the boundary between the tribe of Judah and the tribe of Benjamin, to the south of Jericho, but not as far south as El-Buqei'a.The Book of Joshua, chapter seven, relates the story from which the valley's name comes. After the problems the Israelites had as a result of Achan's immoral theft of items commanded to be destroyed, the Israelite community stoned Achan and his household. Liberal scholars and archaeologists regard the narrative about Achan as an aetiological myth, and instead suspect that it gained this name for another reason.Due to the horrific nature of this narrative, the phrase "valley of trouble" became eminently proverbial and occurs elsewhere in the Hebrew Bible. The Book of Isaiah and Book of Hosea use the term - "the valley of trouble, a place for herds to lie down in" (Isaiah ), "the valley of trouble for a door of hope" (Hosea ) as a way of describing the redemption promised by God.

  <page name="Cabot Strait">Cabot Strait (; , ) is a strait in eastern Canada approximately 110 kilometres wide between Cape Ray, Newfoundland and Cape North, Cape Breton Island. It is the widest of the three outlets for the Gulf of Saint Lawrence into the Atlantic Ocean, the others being the Strait of Belle Isle and Strait of Canso. It is named for the Genoese explorer Giovanni Caboto.The strait's bathymetry is varied, with the Laurentian Channel creating a deep trench through its centre, and comparatively shallow coastal waters closer to Newfoundland and Cape Breton Island. These bathymetric conditions have been known by mariners to cause rogue waves. The steep slope of the Laurentian Channel was the site of a disastrous submarine landslide at the southeastern end of the strait, triggered by the 1929 Grand Banks earthquake and leading to a tsunami that devastated communities along Newfoundland's south coast and parts of Cape Breton Island.A strategically important waterway throughout Canadian and Newfoundland history, the strait is also an important international shipping route, being the primary waterway linking the Atlantic with inland ports on the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Seaway.The strait is crossed daily by the Marine Atlantic ferry service linking Channel-Port aux Basques, and North Sydney. Ferries have been operating across the strait since 1898 and a submarine telegraph cable was laid in 1856 as part of the transatlantic telegraph cable project.An infamous location in the strait for shipwrecks during the age of sail, St. Paul's Island, came to be referred to as the ""Graveyard of the Gulf" (of St. Lawrence)".In October 1942, German U-boat "U-69" torpedoed and sank the unlit Newfoundland ferry , killing 137 people. Then on 25 November 1944 HMCS Shawinigan was torpedoed and sunk with all hands on board (91 crew) by "U-1228".

Designed by Enric Sagnier, the church took 60 years to construct and is topped by a sculpture of the Sacred Heart of Jesus by Josep Miret Llopart.Tibidabo can be reached via the Tibidabo Funicular, which was the first of its kind in Spain, and by the Tramvia Blau or road. The Transports Metropolitans de Barcelona minibus service 111 connects it to Vallvidrera village and the upper station of the Vallvidrera funicular.The name derives from the Latin Vulgate Bible verses:This phrase, meaning "I will give to you", was said to Jesus by the devil as they looked down from an "exceedingly high mountain" upon "all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them." The name of Barcelona's hill thus refers to the popular tradition that it was in fact the "exceedingly high mountain" itself. The phrase "Tibi dabo" forms part of the inscription in the central dome of St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City, although in that case it was drawn from Jesus' words to St. Peter in .

  <page name="El Carmel">El Carmel (), or simply Carmel, is a neighbourhood in the district of Horta-Guinardó, in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.Carmel is in the municipal district of Horta-Guinardó. The area was developed mainly in the 1960s and 1970s when immigrant workers, encouraged to move to Barcelona by the government of the dictator Francisco Franco built housing for themselves. The combination of houses, then isolated on the rural hillside of what is now Parc dels Tres Turons ("Three Hills Park"), ad-hoc buildings put up without building permits and more planned urban development has given the area its modern appearance of many buildings piled on the hillside.Carmel became infamous in 2005 when there was a major tunnel construction accident. It brought to a halt the expansion works on line 5 of the Barcelona Metro and led to the evacuation of dozens of buildings in the area. Local residents protested and most of those evacuated to other areas have finally been rehoused and a new school opened. The Barcelona City Council has pledged more investment in the area to improve transport, accessibility and services.

  <page name="Touraine">Touraine () is one of the traditional provinces of France. Its capital was Tours. During the political reorganization of French territory in 1790, Touraine was divided between the departments of Indre-et-Loire, :Loir-et-Cher and Indre.Traversed by the Loire and its tributaries the Cher, the Indre and the Vienne, Touraine makes up a part of the Paris Basin. It is well known for its viticulture. The TGV, which connects Tours with Paris in just over an hour, has made Touraine a place of residence for people who work in the capital but seek a different quality of life.Touraine takes its name from a Celtic tribe called the Turones, who inhabited the region about two thousand years ago.In 1044, the control of Touraine was given to the Angevins, who (as the House of Plantagenet) became kings of England in 1154, the castle of Chinon being their greatest stronghold. In 1205, Philip II Augustus of France regained Touraine. At this time, Touraine was made into a royal duchy. In 1429, Saint Joan of Arc had a historic meeting with the future King of France Charles VII at Chinon. Throughout the late 15th and 16th centuries, Touraine was a favorite residence of French kings, and the dark and gloomy castles were converted to Renaissance châteaux; for this reason the region was titled "The Garden of France". These same châteaux became popular tourist attractions in modern times. The royal duchy became a province in 1584, and was divided into departments in 1790.Touraine is celebrated for its many châteaux: examples are those at Amboise, Azay-le-Rideau, Chenonceaux, Chinon, Langeais, Loches and Villandry.Official website: Touraine Tourism Board

  <page name="Vaucluse">The Vaucluse ( ; in classical norm or "Vau-Cluso" in Mistralian norm) is a department in the southeast of France, named after the famous spring, the Fontaine-de-Vaucluse. The name Vaucluse derives from the Latin Vallis Clausa (closed valley) as the valley here ends in a cliff face from which emanates a spring whose origin is so far in and so deep that it remains to be defined.Vaucluse was created on 12 August 1793 out of parts of the departments of Bouches-du-Rhône, Drôme, and Basses-Alpes (later renamed Alpes-de-Haute-Provence). The then rural department was, like the nearby city of Lyon, a hotbed of the French Resistance in World War II.Vaucluse is bordered by the Rhône to the west and the River Durance to the south. Mountains occupy a significant proportion of the eastern half of the department, with Mont Ventoux (1,912 m), also known as "the Giant of Provence", dominating the landscape.

  <page name="Benabarre">Benabarre (), in Ribagorçan and Aragonese: Benavarri (, ) is a town in the Aragonese county of Ribagorza, in the province of Huesca, Spain.Traditionally, Benabarre was the capital of the historic County of Ribagorza, which was more expansive in territory than today, and included the comarca of Alta Ribagorça, now in the province of Lleida, Catalonia.It was during the Spanish War of Independence, from 1808-1814, that the French Napoleonic troops, in retaliation, decided to make Graus the temporary capital of the county. Graus' population since that time has increased such that it is the largest town in Ribagorza and has consequently evolved into the role of administrative county seat. Despite this, Benabarre continues to be a significant historical and cultural center of attraction.In 1991, Benabarre's population was at 1,233, and has since declined to 1,112, as of 2004.Situated within the geo-linguistic area of La Franja, Benabarre's local dialect of Ribagorçan is a form of Catalan.

  <page name="Mount Tahan">Mount Tahan (), at 2,187 m, is the highest point in Peninsular Malaysia. It is located within the Taman Negara national forest, in the state of Pahang. The mountain is part of the Tahan Range in the Tenasserim Hills and is popular with local climbers.In the Malay language, ‘gunung’ means ‘mountain’, while ‘tahan’ means ‘endure’. Thus, the name of the mountain suggests that a certain level of physical endurance is required to conquer it. Gunung Tahan is considered by many to be one of the toughest treks in Peninsular Malaysia.There are three trails to the summit, commonly referred to as:1) Kuala Tahan-Kuala Tahan2) Merapoh-Kuala Tahan or Kuala Tahan-Merapoh3) Merapoh-MerapohThe Kuala Tahan classic trail is the oldest and most scenic trail. A return trip on this trail typically takes seven days. Climbers have to trek across undulating ridges and make several river crossings before finally reaching the foot of the mountain to make the final ascent. Climbers without adequate physical fitness or training are not advised to attempt Gunung Tahan.The other two trails are from Merapoh (Sungai Relau). The Merapoh-Merapoh trail is significantly shorter than the other two. A return trip on the Merapoh trail takes 3–4 days. A traverse from Kuala Tahan to Merapoh (or the other way around) takes around 5 days.Mount Tahan can be very cold in night. In December to January, its temperature can be from 4 °C to 18 °C. And in June to September, its temperature can be from 7 °C to 27 °C. Frost can sometimes appear at the summit.

  <page name="Champagne-Ardenne">Champagne-Ardenne () is a former administrative region of France, located in the northeast of the country, bordering Belgium. Mostly corresponding to the historic province of Champagne, the region is famous for its sparkling white wine, named champagne after the eponymous wine region.The administrative region was formed in 1956, consisting of the four departments Aube, Ardennes, Haute-Marne, and Marne. On 1 January 2016, it merged with the neighboring regions of Alsace and Lorraine to form the new region Grand Est, thereby ceasing to exist as an independent entity.Its rivers, most of which flow west, include the Seine, the Marne, and the Aisne. The Meuse flows north.The rail network includes the Paris–Strasbourg line, which follows the Marne Valley and serves Épernay, Châlons-en-Champagne, and Vitry-le-François. The LGV Est TGV line also connecting Paris and Strasbourg opened in 2007 and serves Reims with a train station in the commune of Bezannes.The region's canals include the Canal latéral à la Marne and Marne-Rhine Canal, the latter connecting to the Marne at Vitry-le-François. These are "petit gabarit" canals.The Vatry International Airport, primarily dedicated to air freight, has a runway long. The airport is in a sparsely populated area just from Paris.The population of Champagne-Ardenne has been in steady decrease since 1982 due to a rural exodus. With 1.3 million people and a density of 52/km², it is one of France's least populated regions. After a brief period of stabilization in the 1990s, the region's population is now among the fastest "dying" in Europe, with several municipalities losing people at a faster rate than a lot of Eastern European areas, especially in the Haute-Marne department. The region is among the oldest in France, has a weak fertility rate, and its immigrant population, while growing, is still minimal compared to the national average.

  <page name="Corrèze">Corrèze (; ) is a department in south-western France, named after the river Corrèze.The inhabitants of the department are called "Corréziens".Corrèze is one of the original 83 departments created during the French Revolution on 4 March 1790. It includes part of the former province of Limousin (the Bas-Limousin).The 1851 census recorded a population of 320,866: this remained relatively constant for the rest of the nineteenth century. During the twentieth century, however, Corrèze shared the experience of many of the country's rural departments as the population fell steadily.Within Corrèze the nineteenth-century railway planners, influenced in part by the department's topography, endowed Brive-la-Gaillarde with good connections and a major junction from which railway lines fanned out in six different directions. The railways arrived in 1860, at an opportune moment, directly after phylloxera had destroyed the local wine industry. The new railways enabled the farms in the area surrounding Brive to specialise in fruits and vegetables which they could now transport rapidly to the larger population centres of central and southern France. Locally, the new agriculture triggered the development, in the Brive basin, of related businesses and industries such as the manufacture of jams and liquors, as well as timber/paper-based packaging businesses.The department is part of the region of Nouvelle-Aquitaine. It is surrounded by the departments of Creuse, Haute-Vienne, Cantal, Puy-de-Dôme, Lot, and Dordogne. Tulle is the prefecture of Corrèze and Brive-la-Gaillarde the largest city.The President of the General Council was François Hollande of the Socialist Party until 2012 when he was elected President of the Republic. Jacques Chirac also served as a Deputy of the National Assembly from here for many years.People who were born or have significantly lived in Corrèze include:

Its boundaries correspond to the former department of Liamone, which existed from 1793 to 1811.The department hit the head-lines at the end of the twentieth century with the assassination at Ajaccio of the prefect Claude Érignac on 6 February 1998.The department is surrounded on three sides by the Mediterranean Sea and on the north by the department of Haute-Corse.The entire island of Corsica is mountainous with many beautiful beaches.The people living in this subregion are called "Southerners" ("Suttanacci").Corsicans are a fiercely independent people. However, on 6 July 2003 a referendum rejected increased autonomy by a very small majority, with 50.98 percent of those voting being against and 49.02 percent for. This was a major setback for the French Minister of the Interior, Nicolas Sarkozy, who had hoped to use Corsica as the first step in his decentralization programme.The President of the Departemental Council is Pierre-Jean Luciani, who has held the office since 2015.South Corsica enjoys the mild and hot climate of Mediterranean Islands, and therefore attracts a lot of tourists. Its gem is the city of Bonifacio, part of which is built upon a huge cliff.But inside mountains are beautiful as well, especially the Aiguilles de Bavella, some naked, needle-like rocks.&lt;br&gt;

The vineyards are scattered around villages including Pouilly-Sur-Loire, which lends its name to the appellation, Tracy sur Loire, Boisgibault, Saint Andelain. The word fumé is French for "smoky", and it is said the name comes from the smoky or flinty quality of these wines. The only grape allowed in the Pouilly-Fumé AC is Sauvignon blanc, which produces wines that are generally crisp, tart, and somewhat grassy.In common with most French wine-producing departments, Nièvre is traditionally a left-wing department. The results of the second round of voting in presidential elections reflect this consistently:Nièvre's best-known political representative was François Mitterrand who served as a Senator and a Deputy for the department, and as mayor of Chateau-Chinon for 22 years before his election to the presidency in 1981.

The industrial tradition endures, but industrial businesses tend to be on a small scale. In 2006 employment by economic sector was reported as follows:In common with many rural departments in France, Haute-Saône has experienced a savage reduction in population, from nearly 350,000 in the middle of the nineteenth century to barely 200,000 on the eve of the Second World War, as people migrated to newly industrialising population centres, often outside Metropolitan France.During the second half of the twentieth century the mass mobility conferred by the surge in automobile ownership permitted some recovery of the population figure to approximately 234,000 in 2004.The rural nature of the department is highlighted by the absence of large towns and cities. Even the department's capital, Vesoul, still had a population below 20,000 in 2010.

One key case concerned the interpretation of s.99 of the , which stated that it was an offence to "take or kill any endangered fauna". Such were the habitat values of the forest that in "Corkill v Forestry Commission", Justice Paul Stein referred to the old growth forest as a "veritable forest dependent zoo". The ruling was that "take" included indirect taking by means of the habitat modification/destruction associated with logging:"Corkill v Forestry Commission of New South Wales" (1991) 73 LGRA 126. That decision went on appeal to the Court of Appeal, and the interpretation was upheld: "Forestry Commission v Corkill" (1991) 73 LGRA 247.These legal cases were combined with an on-site blockade of logging work, the blockade being undertaken by experienced and inexperienced green activists and locals many of whom camped in the forest; using techniques such as chaining protesters inside concrete pipes and up six metre high tripods.

  <page name="Yuraygir National Park">Yuraygir is a national park in New South Wales, Australia, located northeast of Sydney. It was created in 1980, a result of the merger and enlargement of two national parks, Angourie and Red Rock National Parks, both of which had been established in 1975. The name is a phonetic translation of the local indigenous tribe who had lived in the area, and had formerly been transcribed variously as Jeigir, Jiegera, Jungai, Yagir, Yegera, Yegir, Yiegera or Youngai. At the time of its establishment in 1980, the park was fragmented, and parcels of land were bought over the following two decades to unite segments into a more contiguous protected area. Sometimes these acquisitions required protracted negotiations (and legal disputes) with land owners.Covering of coastline, it is the largest coastal park in New South Wales. The Yuraygir coastal walk traverses the coastline, and takes four days to complete.

  <page name="Cap-Vert">Cap-Vert is a peninsula in Senegal, and the westernmost point of the continent of Africa and of the Old World mainland. Originally called Cabo Verde or "Green Cape" by Portuguese explorers, it is not to be confused with the "Cape Verde" islands, which are some further west. Dakar, the capital of Senegal, is located near the southern tip.Cap-Vert is a rocky promontory extending west from the main sandy areas of Senegal. Cap-Vert has an excellent harbor, facing Gorée Island.Formed by a combination of volcanic offshore islands and a land bridge produced by coastal currents, it projects into the Atlantic Ocean, bending back to the southeast at its tip. Exposure to southwesterly winds contributes to Cape Verde's seasonal verdant appearance, in contrast to the undulating yellow dunes to the north.The peninsula is shaped like a triangle (about per side), with the base of the triangle roughly along the north and its apex on the south, near Dakar. Near Pointe des Almadies, the north-western tip of the cape, lies Dakar's international airport, famous as a transatlantic ferrying point during World War II. Twin volcanic cones, the Deux Mamelles ("Two Teats"), dominate the landscape along the coast northwest of Dakar. The peninsula embraces a bay and a natural harbour in the southwest.The indigenous inhabitants of the peninsula, the Lebou, lived as fishermen and farmers. Since about 1444, when the Portuguese first sighted the cape, it has been an entrepôt for African-European trade. The French later established the city of Dakar on the cape in 1857.

Beginning in 2021, its official name will be Judbarra National Park.The park consists of two geographically disjoint sections. The larger section lies to the southwest of the smaller northeastern section.The park includes traditional lands of several Indigenous Australian groups, including Ngarinyman, Karrangpurru, Malngin, Wardaman, Ngaliwurru, Nungali, Bilinara, Gurindji and Jaminjung, and spans the boundary between two major Australian language families, Pama Nyungan and Non-Pama-Nyungan (Northern).The rock shelters and caves in Judbarra / Gregory contain an extensive amount of rock art, variously created by painting, stencilling, drawing, printing, and "pecking and pounding". The human figure is the most common motif; the park is "one of the most prolific sites in Australia" for composite engraved and painted human figures. The rock art of the Judbarra region is considered to represent a distinct art province.The park has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it supports much of the eastern subspecies of the white-quilled rock-pigeon and small numbers of the endangered Gouldian finch, as well as populations of the chestnut-backed buttonquail, partridge pigeon, yellow-rumped mannikin and several other near-threatened or savanna-biome-restricted species.

  <page name="Lake Gairdner National Park">Lake Gairdner National Park is a protected area associated with Lake Gairdner in South Australia (Australia), 436 km northwest of Adelaide. It is located just south of the Trans-Australian Railway, Stuart Highway, and the Woomera Prohibited area.The national park consists of the following salt lakes (from east to west) - Lake Gairdner, Lake Harris and Lake Everard.There is very limited public access to this park which is surrounded by pastoral leases. The easiest public access is from the main road running from Yardea to Kingoonya, at The Brothers Well, a concrete catchment at the side of the road at the Southern end of Moonarie station (though the road signs would have you believe that you were on Yardea Station). The road is dirt, but quite good enough for two-wheel drive vehicles unless it is wet, when it is likely that it will be closed by the Highways Dept..Ordinarily, the country is totally arid, and devoid of free water, surface or underground. In the summer it can be extremely hot: in the springtime, though, this country has great attraction for birdwatchers and botanists.This region is the home country of the Kokatha people, and traces of their occupation may still be found: sacred sites are still visited for ceremonies.The national park contains the historic Glenloth Gold Battery Site, located at its western end on the shore of Lake Harris, which is listed on the South Australian Heritage Register as a designated place of archaeological significance.

The Mount Augustus Sandstone was deposited by ancient river systems and is somewhat younger than the 1.64 billion year old granite beneath. The originally horizontal sediments have been folded into an asymmetric anticline by later tectonic movements.Francis Thomas Gregory reached the summit on 3 June 1858 during his 107-day journey through the Gascoyne region, becoming the first recorded European to climb the mountain. Some weeks later he named the peak after his brother, Sir Augustus Charles Gregory (1819–1905).

  <page name="Cape Upstart National Park">Cape Upstart is a national park in the locality of Guthalungra in the Whitsunday Region local government area of North Queensland, Australia, 1,016 km northwest of Brisbane.The "Juru" Clan of the "Birri-Gubba" Tribal Group lived on Cape Upstart for thousands of years.There are numerous middens in the sand dunes of Cape Upstart to demonstrate the connection of the "Juru" People to Cape Upstart. There are also several sacred sites, like the women's area at Worrungu Bay, and the stone arrangements near Mine Island, which the senior elder always stated were never 'fish traps' but an important ceremonial ground used for initiation. The ceremonial ground laid out the paths taken by "Gubulla Munda" (the Carpet Snake) when creating the land and islands inhabited by the Juru people and the paths followed by "Gubulla Munda" (the totem of the "Juru" Clan) in the "Gubulla Munda Dreaming" (the creation story of the "Juru" and "Birri-Gubba" People).Europeans, mostly from the nearby Burdekin farming community, began - in the early twentieth century - building semi-permanent huts on the Cape's western foreshores. By the start of the twenty-first century these had mostly been replaced by permanent structures used mostly for recreational purposes, a small permanent population having also taken up residency by then.In 2011 Justice Rares of the Federal Court of Australia recognised that the "Juru" People retained Native Title over Cape Upstart National Park. This decision was the culmination of a twenty-year struggle by the "Juru" People to get their Native Title recognised over Cape Upstart National Park. The Process was originally started by Peter Prior (Gulumba) in 1992 and was completed by his daughter, Renarta Prior (Gootha) in 2012.

  <page name="Holbourne Island National Park">Holbourne Island National Park is a national park in Queensland (Australia), 983 km northwest of Brisbane.Holbourne Island became well known in 1875, when 18 survivors of the shipwreck SS Gothenburg reached its shores. Four survivors arrived on a damaged port lifeboat on 25 February, where they survived by eating raw bird's eggs and drinking rain water that had pooled in the island rocks. The following day, 14 survivors from a starboard lifeboat also landed. Because rescue was uncertain, the survivors engraved their names on the concave side of a large turtle shell, which is displayed in the South Australian Museum, on North Terrace in Adelaide.On Sunday, 28 February, 15 of them set off in the starboard lifeboat for an island about away to the south, which seemed to be more in the track of ships. A rescue ship sent looking for survivors of the "Gothenburg", picked up the group and took them safely to Bowen. The ship subsequently returned to Holbourne Island and rescued the three remaining survivors.As well as being a national park, Holbourne Island is well known as a natural bird sanctuary and turtle nesting area.On 2 September 2001, the 50,000 gross ton bulk carrier "Pax Phoenix" departed Hay Point, Queensland bound for India via Singapore.

  <page name="Hope Islands National Park">Hope Islands National Park is a national park in Queensland (Australia) 1,521 km north-west of Brisbane. The park consists of four islands: East Hope and West Hope, Snapper Island and Struck Island.Access is via private vessel or by permitted commercial operators.The Hope islands were named by Lt James Cook in June 1770, as his ship "HMS Endeavour" edged its way northward along the eastern Australian coastline during his first voyage in the Pacific. Cook had hoped to put ashore on the islands when they were first sighted 10 June 1770, but found the surrounding water too shallow to bring "Endeavour" close. Later that night "Endeavour" struck a reef and narrowly avoided sinking; Cook then stood her offshore while he searched for a point on the mainland upon which to beach her for repairs. Cook named them on 12 June as "Endeavour" headed further north, because "we were always in hopes of being able to reach these Islands."

  <page name="Bungay Castle">Bungay Castle is in the town of Bungay, Suffolk by the River Waveney.Originally this was a Norman castle built by Roger Bigod of Norfolk, around 1100, which took advantage of the protection given by the curve of the River Waveney. Roger's son, Hugh Bigod, was a prominent player in the civil war years of the Anarchy, and his loyalty was called into question during the early years of the reign of Henry II. Henry confiscated Bungay, returning it in 1164. Hugh went on to build a large square Norman keep on the site in 1165. It is not recorded how much it cost to build the keep, but Hugh Braun who led the excavations at the castle in the 1930s estimated that it would have cost around £1,400. Hugh ended up on the losing side in the Revolt of 1173–1174, Bungay was besieged, mined and ultimately destroyed by royal forces.The site was subsequently restored yet again to the Bigods and was further developed in 1294 by Roger Bigod, 5th Earl of Norfolk, who probably built the massive gate towers on the site. Roger fell out with Edward I and after his death the castle reverted to the Crown, falling into disrepair and ruin. From 1483, it was primarily owned by the Dukes of Norfolk until the 20th century.Restoration work on the castle began in 1934, following work by the amateur archaeologist Leonard Cane. The curtain walls and the twin towers of the gatehouse remain today, as well as a fragment of the keep. Bungay Castle was given to the town of Bungay by the Duke of Norfolk in 1987, and is now owned by the Bungay Castle Trust. The castle is a Grade I listed building.

They build systems of wooden tripods across the rapids fixed in holes carved in the rock by the water current. They serve as anchors for baskets that entrap large fish.According to Stanley, "...by taking advantage of the rocks, the natives have been enabled to fix upright heavy poles, 6 inches in diameter, to each of which they attach enormous fish-baskets by means of rattan-cane cable. There are probably sixty or seventy baskets laid in the river on each side, every day; and though some may be brought up empty, in general they seem to be tolerably successful, for out of half-a-dozen baskets...twenty-eight large fish were collected..."

It is under the "de facto" control of Northern Cyprus.The village was the home for some years of Lawrence Durrell, who wrote about life in Cyprus in his book "Bitter Lemons". He mentions passing the time drinking coffee under the Tree of Idleness in the village and there are two places which lay claim to being the spot. Unfortunately his book did not identify it completely, or perhaps fortunately, because two establishments can now profit from the name. His house, up a very steep climb, has a plaque on it and one can have the pleasure of returning by a not-quite-so-perpendicular way that passes by old olive presses.The jewel of the village is Bellapais Abbey or "The Abbey of Peace (from French: "Abbaye de la Belle Paix"). Built by canons regular of the Premonstratensian Order in the 13th century, it is a most imposing ruin in a wonderful position commanding a long view down to Kyrenia and the Mediterranean sea.Most of the monastic buildings surround the cloister. In Britain these would normally be built on the south side of the church so to some extent protect the living quarters from the cold air from the north. At Bellapais, the monastic buildings are on the north, probably to be cooler, although occasionally the lay of the land dictated position.

  <page name="Byland Abbey">Byland Abbey is a ruined abbey and a small village in the Ryedale district of North Yorkshire, England, in the North York Moors National Park.It was founded as a Savigniac abbey in January 1135 and was absorbed by the Cistercian order in 1147. It wasn't an easy start for the community who had had to move five times before settling at New Byland, near Coxwold in 1177. In 1290 a large round "silver disc" was seen hovering over the abbey.Its early history was marked by disputes with no fewer than four other religious establishments: (Furness Abbey, Calder Abbey, Rievaulx Abbey and Newburgh Priory). However, once it had overcome this bad start, it was described in the late 14th century as "one of the three shining lights of the north". Its financial success was not as great as that of places like Rievaulx, but it was famed for its sheep rearing and wool exports. Its church was said to be among the finest 12th-century churches in Europe.It was dissolved on 30 November 1538. In 1539, its site was granted to Sir William Pickering.Impressive remains can still be seen, in the care of English Heritage, including the lower half of a huge rose window.

  <page name="River Wantsum">The River Wantsum is a tributary of the River Stour, in Kent, England. Formerly, the River Wantsum and the River Stour together formed the Wantsum Channel, which separated the Isle of Thanet from the mainland of Kent. Now the River Wantsum is little more than a drainage ditch starting at Reculver, and ending where it joins the Stour.Bede, in the 8th century, said that the Wantsum – meaning Wantsum Channel – was "about three furlongs broad [], and is fordable only in two places, for both ends run into the sea". In 1414 there was still a ferry crossing the Wantsum at Sarre, but by 1550 Thanet was no longer an island. At Reculver, the Romans built a fort that was about from the sea, whereas Leland, in the early 16th century, described Reculver as being from the sea, and the great storm of 1809 carried away half of the fort. It is postulated that the eroded material was carried along the shore and blocked the northern mouth of the Wantsum.The River Wantsum now joins the Great Stour from the north as a small tributary, just before the Little Stour enters it from the south to form what is thereafter known simply as the River Stour.

The present house is mainly Elizabethan, with a Gothic façade added in the 1820s to a design probably by John Buckler.In 1945 the Hall, then in a neglected and dilapidated state, was sold by Gerald Bagot, 5th Baron Bagot, together with its estate to South Staffordshire Waterworks Company, whose intention was to build a reservoir (completed in 1953). The 5th Baron died in 1946 having sold many of the contents of the house. His successor and cousin Caryl Bagot, 6th Baron Bagot, repurchased the property and of land from the water company and began an extensive programme of renovation and restoration.In September 1959 Lord Bagot sold Blithfield Hall at an open auction held in the Shrewsbury Arms, Rugeley. The property was bought for £12,000 ("2011: £") by his wife Nancy, Lady Bagot.The 6th Baron died in 1961. In 1986, the Hall was divided into four separate houses. The main part which incorporates the Great Hall is owned by the Bagot Jewitt Trust. The Bagot Jewitt family remain in residence.On a Monday in early September every year, villagers from nearby Abbots Bromley visit the Hall to perform the Abbots Bromley Horn Dance.Blithfield Hall is known as the home of a breed of goat, the Bagot goat. The part of the parish known as Bagot's Bromley took its name from ownership by the family since 1360. Bagot's Wood, the remains of the ancient Needwood Forest also takes its name from the Bagots.

  <page name="Yosemite Falls">Yosemite Falls is the highest waterfall in Yosemite National Park, dropping a total of from the top of the upper fall to the base of the lower fall. Located in the Sierra Nevada of California, it is a major attraction in the park, especially in late spring when the water flow is at its peak.The falls consist of three sections:In years of little snow, the falls may actually cease flowing altogether in late summer or fall. A very small number of rock climbers have taken the opportunity to climb the normally inaccessible rock face beneath the falls, although this is an extraordinarily dangerous undertaking; a single afternoon thunderstorm could restart the falls, sweeping the climbers off the face.Lower Yosemite Fall is easily accessible near the Yosemite Lodge in Yosemite Valley. The top of Upper Yosemite Fall may be reached via a steep, strenuous, and usually crowded hike beginning near Camp 4. The Upper Fall may also be reached via several routes from the Tioga Road to the north.The main village of the native people of Yosemite Valley, the Ahwahneechee, was located at the base of the falls.The Ahwahneechee people called the waterfall "Cholock" ("the fall") and believed that the plunge pool at its base was inhabited by the spirits of several witches, called the Poloti. An Ahwaneechee folktale describes a woman going to fetch a pail of water from the pool, and drawing it out full of snakes. Later that night, after the woman had trespassed into their territory, the spirits caused the woman's house to be sucked into the pool by a powerful wind, taking the woman and her newborn baby with it.

The old trading town on Helgö began to emerge around the year 200 AD, 500 years before Birka at Björkö. The first archaeological dig in 1954 uncovered the remains of the early settlement, including a workshop area which attracted international interest. The most notable finds included a small Buddha statuette from North India and a christening scoop from Egypt, both dating from the 6th century. The Indian Buddha statuette, the Irish crozier and the Egyptian Coptic scoop which were found on Helgö, are presently on display in the Swedish History Museum in Stockholm.The site where Kaggeholm Palace is located was first mentioned in a land title document in 1287. During the 1500s the farm was owned by members of the families Grip and Bååt. The farm was originally called Vettersjö, but was named by Swedish Count Lars Kagg (1595-1661) who bought the manor during 1647.

  <page name="Table Bay">Table Bay (Afrikaans "Tafelbaai") is a natural bay on the Atlantic Ocean overlooked by Cape Town (founded 1652 by Van Riebeeck) and is at the northern end of the Cape Peninsula, which stretches south to the Cape of Good Hope. It was named because it is dominated by the flat-topped Table Mountain.Bartolomeu Dias was the first European to explore this region in 1486. The bay, although famous for centuries as a haven for ships, is actually a rather poor natural harbour and is badly exposed to gales from both the SE and NW. Many sailing ships seeking refuge in the bay during the 17th and 18th centuries were driven ashore by storms (see the article about Wolraad Woltemade).The Dutch colonists nevertheless persisted with their efforts on the shores of Table Bay, because good natural harbours along this coastline are almost non-existent. The best of them- Saldanha Bay- lacked fresh water and the only realistic alternatives- Simon's Bay and Houtbaai- were rightly inaccessible at the time and only marginally less exposed to the weather, which is notoriously bad often enough in the Cape Peninisula (see article on S.S. Maori and Sea Point). Eventually a harbour was built in Table Bay by a process of land reclamation and was defended by breakwaters to protect shipping. The older part of this structure is called the Victoria Dock. The newer part is called the Duncan Dock.Robben Island, where Nelson Mandela was imprisoned for decades, is in this bay.

In the 10th century AD, it was the eastern border province of the Holy Roman Empire; castles were built here in order to move the borders eastwards. The Altmark was a swampy and heavily contested region for centuries. In the 12th century, many swamps were drained, and the strongholds became small towns.

  <page name="Wayne National Forest">The Wayne National Forest is located in the south-eastern part of the US state of Ohio, in the Unglaciated Allegheny Plateau. It is the only national forest in Ohio. Forest headquarters are located between The Plains and Nelsonville, Ohio, on US Route 33, overlooking the Hocking River.The originally forested land was cleared for agricultural and lumbering use in the late 18th and 19th century, but years of poor timbering and agricultural practices led to severe erosion and poor soil composition. The Wayne National Forest was started as part of a reforestation program.The forest comprises three administrative and purchase units: Athens, Marietta, and Ironton. Many of the lands included in the forest are former coal-mining lands, and much of this land is owned by the federal government without the mineral rights, those having been retained by former owners.As of January 2012, the forest has in federal ownership within a proclamation boundary of .The area of Ohio included within the Forest is based on late Paleozoic geology, heavy in sandstones and shales, including redbeds, with many coal beds. The topography is typically very rugged, with elevation changes typically in the 200–400-foot range.The North Country Trail passes through several areas of the Wayne, in which it is coincident with the Buckeye Trail and the American Discovery Trail.

  <page name="Howden Reservoir">The Howden Reservoir is a Y-shaped reservoir, top one of the three in the Upper Derwent Valley, England. The western half of the reservoir lies in Derbyshire, whereas the eastern half is in Sheffield, South Yorkshire. The county border runs through the middle of the reservoir, following the original path of the River Derwent. The longest arm is around 1.25 miles (2 km) in length. The reservoir is bounded at the southern end by Howden Dam; below this, the River Derwent flows immediately into Derwent Reservoir and subsequently the Ladybower Reservoir. Other tributaries include the River Westend, Howden Clough and Linch Clough.Work commenced on the dams construction on 16 July 1901 and completed in July 1912. The works involved constructing a temporary village at Birchinlee, or "Tin Town", for the workers, a temporary railway line from the main line at Bamford, construction of a link aqueduct to the Derwent Dam. The dam is of solid masonry construction, and , , and impounds of water, from a catchment area of . The workers who died during the construction of the dam were buried in Bamford Church.To the east of the reservoir stands the hill of Featherbed Moss, one of the highest tops in the area at 545 m, and one of several tops of that name in the area.

  <page name="River Dane">The River Dane is a tributary of the River Weaver in the Peak District area of England. It forms the border between first Cheshire and Derbyshire on the west and east, and then between Cheshire and Staffordshire before meeting the Weaver near Northwich.The river rises close to the source of the River Goyt just to the south west of Buxton, on Axe Edge Moor. Flowing southwest, it forms county borders for around before flowing west through Congleton and past Holmes Chapel.The point on the river where the three counties meet, at Panniers' Pool Bridge, is called the Three Shire Heads (often wrongly Three Shires Head). Three Shire Heads is the most northern point in Staffordshire.Passing just to the north of Middlewich, it merges first with the River Croco near the site of the old Roman fort in Harbutt's Field, and then with the River Wheelock near the aqueduct carrying the Trent and Mersey Canal, and runs the remaining north to Northwich where it flows into the River Weaver.The name of the river (earlier "Daven") is probably from the Old Welsh "dafn", meaning a "drop or tickle", implying a slow-moving river.

  <page name="Wieskirche">The Pilgrimage Church of Wies () is an oval rococo church, designed in the late 1740s by brothers J. B. and Dominikus Zimmermann, the latter of whom lived nearby for the last eleven years of his life. It is located in the foothills of the Alps, in the municipality of Steingaden in the Weilheim-Schongau district, Bavaria, Germany.It is said that, in 1738, tears were seen on a dilapidated wooden figure of the Scourged Saviour. This miracle resulted in a pilgrimage rush to see the sculpture. In 1740, a small chapel was built to house the statue but it was soon realized that the building would be too small for the number of pilgrims it attracted, and so Steingaden Abbey decided to commission a separate shrine. Many who have prayed in front of the statue of Jesus on the altar have claimed that people have been miraculously cured of their diseases, which has made this church even more of a pilgrimage site.Construction took place between 1745 and 1754, and the interior was decorated with frescoes and with stuccowork in the tradition of the Wessobrunner School. "Everything was done throughout the church to make the supernatural visible. Sculpture and murals combined to unleash the divine in visible form".There is a popular belief that the Bavarian government planned to sell or demolish the rococo masterpiece during the secularization of Bavaria at the beginning of the 19th century, and that only protests from the local farmers saved it from destruction. Available sources, however, document that the responsible state commission clearly advocated the continuation of Wies as a pilgrimage site, even in spite of economic objections from the abbot of Steingaden.The "Wieskirche" was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1983 and underwent extensive restoration between 1985 and 1991.

  <page name="Upper Franconia">Upper Franconia () is a "Regierungsbezirk" (administrative ["Regierungs"] region ["bezirk"]) of the state of Bavaria, southern Germany. It forms part of the historically significant region of Franconia ("See also: Middle Franconia and Lower Franconia"), all now part of the German Federal State of Bayern ("Bavaria").With more than 200 independent breweries which brew approximately 1000 different types of beer, Upper Franconia has the worlds highest brewery-density per capita. A special Franconian beer route ("Fränkische Brauereistraße") leads along popular breweries.The administrative region borders on Thuringia ("Thüringen") to the north, Lower Franconia ("Unterfranken") to the west, Middle Franconia ("Mittelfranken") to the south-west, and Upper Palatinate ("Oberpfalz") to the south-east, Saxony ("Sachsen") to the north-east and the Czech Republic to the east.After the founding of the Kingdom of Bavaria the state was totally reorganised and, in 1808, divided into 15 administrative government regions (German: Regierungsbezirke (singular Regierungsbezirk)), in Bavaria called Kreise (singular: Kreis). They were created in the fashion of the French departements, quite even in size and population, and named after their main rivers.In the following years, due to territorial changes (e. g. loss of Tyrol, addition of the Palatinate), the number of Kreise was reduced to 8. One of these was the Mainkreis (Main District). In 1837 king Ludwig I of Bavaria renamed the Kreise after historical territorial names and tribes of the area. This also involved some border changes or territorial swaps. Thus the name Mainkreis changed to Upper Franconia.Oberfranken is subdivided into nine "Landkreise" (districts) and four "Kreisfreie Städte" (district-free or independent cities)."Landkreise":"Kreisfreie Städte":

The river valley broadens below Wilton, and the river passes through the center of Milford, crosses the southern portion of Amherst, and enters the town of Merrimack. Shortly upstream of the town center, the river passes over Wildcat Falls, then crosses under the Everett Turnpike and U.S. Route 3 to reach the Merrimack River.The river is used for water supplies, a small amount of hydropower, and recreation. There are 28 threatened or endangered species sharing the watershed with 35,000 people. It is part of the New Hampshire Rivers Management Protection Program.It was one of two rivers studied by the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services to reach data and recommendations about allowable "instream flow".The name "Souhegan" comes from the language of the Native American Algonquins, meaning "waiting and watching place". Tribal fishermen set weirs across the rapids, and then waited and watched for fish, including salmon, alewives, sturgeon, and eels.The name of Skowhegan, Maine, comes from the same term.

  <page name="Lombok Strait">The Lombok Strait (Indonesian: "Selat Lombok"), is a strait connecting the Java Sea to the Indian Ocean, and is located between the islands of Bali and Lombok in Indonesia. The Gili Islands are on the Lombok side.Its narrowest point is at its southern opening, with a width of about 20 km between the islands of Lombok and Nusa Penida, in the middle of the strait. At the northern opening, it is 40 km across. Its total length is about 60 km. Because it is 250 m deep — much deeper than the Strait of Malacca — ships that draw too much water to pass through Malacca (so-called "post Malaccamax" vessels) often use the Lombok Strait, instead.The Lombok Strait is notable as one of the main passages for the Indonesian Throughflow that exchanges water between the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean.It is also part of the biogeographical boundary between the fauna of Indomalaya ecozone and the distinctly different fauna of Australasia. The boundary is known as the Wallace Line, for Alfred Russel Wallace, who first remarked upon the striking difference between animals of Indo-Malaysia from those of Australasia and how abrupt the boundary was between the two biomes.Biologists believe it was the depth of the Lombok Strait itself that kept the animals on either side isolated from one another. When sea levels dropped during the Pleistocene ice age, the islands of Bali, Java and Sumatra were all connected to one another and to the mainland of Asia. They shared the Asian fauna. The Lombok Strait's deep water kept Lombok and the Lesser Sunda archipelago isolated from the Asian mainland. These islands were, instead, colonized by Australasian fauna.

  <page name="Karimata Strait">The Karimata Strait () is the wide strait that connects the South China Sea to the Java Sea, dividing the islands of Sumatra and Borneo (Kalimantan), both bordering the strait from Indonesian territory. It was known to British sailors in the 18-19th century as the Caramata Passage.The strait is about 150 kilometres (94 mi) wide, as measured from the east coast of the island of Belitung (or Billiton) to the west coast of Borneo (Kalimantan). The much narrower Gaspar Strait separates Belitung from Bangka Island to the west. Bangka lies close to the east coast of Sumatra, separated from it by the Bangka Strait. The Karimata Islands lie in the eastern part of the Karimata strait, north-east of Belitung and off-shore from the west coast of Borneo.On 28 December 2014 Indonesia AirAsia Flight 8501 crashed into the strait.

A meeting held on 17 March 1863 decided to build a church on "Tustern" (which was the name of the island at that time) and thereby gain status as a separate parish. Gullstein Church was built in the village of Gullstein on the eastern side of the island in 1864.

On 1 January 1965, the part of Tustna on the island of Ertvågsøy (population: 85) was transferred to neighboring Aure Municipality to the east. On 1 January 2006, all of Tustna Municipality was merged into Aure Municipality. At its end, Tustna had a population of 1,006.The municipality was named after the island of Tustna. The name of the island was first mentioned, as "Toester", on a Dutch map from 1623. It may be derived from Old Norse "þústr" which means "staff" or "stick", and in that case it is probably referring to the form of one of the mountains on the island.

Neighboring districts are Diepholz, Nienburg, Schaumburg, Lippe, Herford, Osnabrück.This is the northernmost district of North Rhine-Westphalia. It protrudes into Lower Saxon territory. The Weser River enters the district in the southeast and leaves to the north. In the south of the district the river runs through a narrow gorge, which is formed by two mountain chains, the Wiehen Hills in the west and the Wesergebirge in the east. This gorge is called Porta Westfalica, since it marks the ancient border of Westphalia.Minden-Lübbecke is roughly identical with the medieval Bishopric of Minden. At its biggest extent in the 13th century, it later lost territory until it came finally to be around the size of today's district. In the 17th century the principality came into the possession of Brandenburg and thus Prussia. Lost for a time to Napoleonic France, it came back to Prussia in 1813, and was then part of the Province of Westphalia.

Tweed (cloth) derives its name from its association with the River Tweed. The Tweed is one of the great salmon rivers of Britain and the only river in England where an Environment Agency rod licence is not required for angling. The name of the river comes from the Gaelic word for north, "tuath" which was later Anglicized into Tweed.It flows primarily through the scenic Borders region of Scotland, and eastwards from the settlements on opposing banks of Birgham and Carham forms the historic boundary between Scotland and England. It rises in the Lowther Hills at Tweed's Well near where the Clyde, draining northwest, and the Annan draining south also rise. "Annan, Tweed and Clyde rise oot the ae hillside" is a saying from the Border region. East of Kelso, it becomes a section of the eastern part of the border. Entering England, its lower reaches are in Northumberland, where it enters the North Sea at Berwick-upon-Tweed.The river's valley floor is a drumlin field and the relic of a paleo-ice stream that flowed through the area during the last glaciation. Major towns through which the Tweed flows include Innerleithen, Peebles, Galashiels, Melrose, Kelso, Coldstream and Berwick-upon-Tweed, where it flows into the North Sea. Tweed tributaries include:

The Österbotten, "Eastern Botten" or Ostrobothnia lay on the Finnish side of the sea and this province name still survives.Following the Fredrikshamn treaty, which redefined the outlines and orientation of Sweden, in 1810 Västerbotten County was split in two parts. The northern portion became Norrbotten County, and the Swedish-speaking locals of Norrbotten (which in itself is a multi-lingual area) soon began referring to themselves as Norrbothnians. The county borders thus gradually led to a local provincial identity. Nowadays Norrbotten is considered a separate province, even though provinces had ceased to have any administrative or legal significance hundreds of years before 1810.Västerbotten Regiment was the provincial regiment.Since the 13th century, Swedish princes in some dynasties have been created dukes of various provinces. Since 1772, these are only nominal titles.Regional football in the province is administered by Västerbottens Fotbollförbund.

  <page name="Altenburger Land">Altenburger Land is a district in Thuringia, Germany. It is bounded by (from the west and clockwise) the district of Greiz, the Burgenlandkreis (Saxony-Anhalt), and the districts Leipziger Land, Mittweida, Chemnitzer Land, Zwickauer Land in Saxony.The region on the Pleiße River was part of a huge forest, where the Thuringii formed the Thuringian Kingdom. After this was in 531 taken over by the Franks, Slavic people were also moving in. Thuringians reestablished independent rule. The castle of Altenburg already existed in the 10th century, it became an imperial seat. In the following centuries German settlers from other parts moved in. It was part of the margravate of Meißen in the 14th century. At this time most of the forests were cleared.The city of Altenburg and the surrounding lands were the tiny duchy of Saxe-Altenburg from 1826 to 1918; afterwards it was a state within the Weimar Republic for a short time, before it was dissolved in 1922 in order to join the state of Thuringia.The district in its present borders was established in 1922 under the name "Altenburg". In 1952 there was an administrative reform splitting the districts into two smaller units, called Altenburg and Schmölln. They were merged again in 1994, but now under the name "Altenburger Land".Altenburger Land is the easternmost district of Thuringia. It is a mainly agricultural region. The main river is the Pleiße, a tributary of the White Elster, crossing the district from south to north. The hilly Osterland constituting the northernmost foothills of the Ore Mountains slopes gently away to the plains of eastern Saxony-Anhalt.

  <page name="Wilsden">Wilsden is a village and civil parish in west Bradford, in West Yorkshire, England. Wilsden is west of Bradford and is close to the Aire Valley and the nearby villages of Denholme, Cullingworth, Harden, Cottingley and Allerton. Wilsden re-acquired civil parish status in 2004. The 2001 census revealed a population of 3,697, increasing to 4,807 at the 2011 Census.Wilsden is recorded as being 'Wealhas-den', which has been suggested as meaning the place or the land of the Welshmen. This is an Anglo-Saxon term as it was believed when they arrived in the Aire Valley, Wilsden was one of the places that the native people retreated to.In 1886, a railway station was opened on the Queensbury to Keighley line that ran to the west of the village. The station was actually in the hamlet of Harecroft, away, and was closed down in May 1955 to passengers and November 1963 to goods.Wilsden has many businesses such as Wilsden Autos, Suite Centre, a Co-op and a post office.The Ling Bob public house was built in 1836 and was originally known as the Brown Cow Inn. It was situated in the hamlet of Ling Bob, which was separate from the village of Wilsden at that time, however, the locals all knew the pub as the Ling Bob, so the name stuck.Wilsden village hall holds lots of groups like scouting groups, walking group, a weekly auction, a pre-school and others.Administratively, it is part of the Bingley Rural ward of the City of Bradford and part of the Shipley constituency.

  <page name="Skjaldbreiður">Skjaldbreiður, meaning the "broad shield" in Icelandic, is an Icelandic lava shield formed in one huge and protracted eruption roughly 9,000 years ago. The extensive lava fields which were produced by this eruption, flowed southwards, and formed the basin of Þingvallavatn, Iceland's largest lake, and Þingvellir, the "Parliament Plains" where the Icelandic national assembly, the Alþing was founded in 930.The volcano summit is at 1,060 metres, and its crater measures roughly 300 metres in diameter.Straddling the Mid-Atlantic ridge, the lava fields from Skjaldbreiður have been torn and twisted over the millennia, forming a multitude of fissures and rifts inside the Þingvellir National Park, the best known of which are Silfra, Almannagjá, Hrafnagjá and Flosagjá.

  <page name="Lake Mariout">Lake Mariout ( ', ), also spelled Maryut or Mariut, is a brackish lake in northern Egypt. The lake area covered 200 km² and had a navigable canal at the beginning of the 20th century, but at the beginning of the 21st century, it covers only about 50 km².It is separated from the Mediterranean Sea by the narrow isthmus on which the city of Alexandria was built. The lake shore is home to fisheries and saltworks. As far back as the early 1900s, it was documented that salt was being refined from the western part of the lake. Some of the marshy areas around the lake have been reclaimed for new building as the city grows and how to manage the pollution that goes into the lake has been considered.According to some records, a nome by the same name (ancient name: Mareotis) was located on the shores of this lake.The name derives from Mareotis or Marea, the name of the lake in ancient times.The fish species Nile perch live in the lake, although it principally needs fresh water to live in, and the lake contains some salt. In 1939, A small lake, called the Nozha Hydrodrome was "isolated from Lake Mariout" and this allowed for the Nile perch to flourish there.In 2015, a steel resembling the Rosetta Stone and dating back some 2,200 years, was discovered in ancient ruins called Taposiris Magna Temple site at Lake Mariout. Measuring 41 inches (105 cm) by 25.6 inches (65 cm) by 7 inches (18 cm) its message commemorates two Ptolemaic pharaohs and Cleopatra I. There are ancient tombs located on the shores of the lake.

  <page name="Prince William Sound">Prince William Sound is a sound of the Gulf of Alaska on the south coast of the U.S. state of Alaska. It is located on the east side of the Kenai Peninsula. Its largest port is Valdez, at the southern terminus of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System. Other settlements on the sound, which contains numerous small islands, include Cordova and Whittier plus the Alaska native villages of Chenega and Tatitlek.James Cook entered Prince William Sound in 1778 and named it Sandwich Sound, after his patron the Earl of Sandwich. The Sound was named in 1778 to honour George III's third son Prince William Henry, then aged 13 and serving as a midshipman in the Royal Navy.In 1793, Alexander Andreyevich Baranov founded port Voskresensk in the sound, which he called Chugach Bay. The first three-masted ship, "Phoenix", was the first ship built by the Russians in America.Most of the land surrounding Prince William Sound is part of the Chugach National Forest, the second largest national forest in the U.S. Prince William Sound is ringed by the steep and glaciated Chugach Mountains. The coastline is convoluted, with many islands and fjords, several of which contain tidewater glaciers. The principal barrier islands forming the sound are Montague Island, Hinchinbrook Island, and Hawkins Island.A 1964 tsunami, a result of the Good Friday earthquake, killed a number of Chugach villagers in the coastal village of Chenega and destroyed the town of Valdez.In 1989, the oil tanker "Exxon Valdez" ran aground on Bligh Reef after leaving Valdez, causing a large oil spill, which resulted in massive damage to the environment, including the killing of around 250,000 seabirds, nearly 3,000 sea otters, 300 harbour seals, 250 bald eagles and up to 22 killer whales.

The bay is part of the Philippine Sea of the Pacific Ocean, and is bounded by two islands; Samar in the north and Leyte in the west. On the south of the bay is Mindanao Island, separated from Leyte by the Surigao Strait. Dinagat Island partly encloses the gulf to the southeast, and the small Homonhon Island and Suluan Island, sit astride the eastern entrance to the Gulf. It is approximately 130 km (80 mi) north-south, and 60 km (40 mi) east-west.Several municipalities are situated on the coast of the gulf: Balangiga, Giporlos, Guiuan, Lawaan, Mercedes, Quinapondan and Salcedo. There are also eleven marine reserves in the gulf region.Leyte Gulf was also the scene of the Battle of Leyte Gulf, which extends to Surigao Strait during the Battle of Surigao Strait, the largest naval battle of World War II and started the end of Japanese occupation in the Philippines.In 2013, Typhoon Haiyan stirred up a storm surge in Leyte Gulf, resulting to massive loss of lives, agricultural land and property along Leyte's shores.Leyte Gulf is identified by the Leyte State University as one of the important fishing grounds of Leyte and Samar. Like other rich fishing grounds such as Maqueda Bay and Carigara Bay, the gulf is known for abundant catches of anchioves, herring, shrimp and crabs. It was also once one of the richest sources of mud crabs in 1985. Fish harvest has been in decline in the gulf due to the use of dynamite fishing. Typhoon Haiyan has damaged the hard coral cover within the gulf's area, further reducing the fish harvest.

On 1 January 2016, Upper and Lower Normandy merged becoming one region called Normandy.It was created in 1956 from two departments: Seine-Maritime and Eure, when Normandy was divided into Lower Normandy and Upper Normandy. This division continued to provoke controversy, and many people continued to call for the two regions to be reunited. The two regions were finally merged on 1 January 2016. The name "Upper Normandy" existed prior to 1956 and referred by tradition to territories currently included within the administrative region: the Pays de Caux, the Pays de Bray (not that of Picardy), the Roumois, the Campagne of Le Neubourg, the Plaine de Saint-André and the Norman Vexin. Today, most of the Pays d'Auge, as well as a small portion of the Pays d'Ouche, are located in Lower Normandy. Rouen and Le Havre are important urban centers.Rouen is the regional capital, historically important with many fine churches and buildings, including the tallest cathedral tower in France.

  <page name="Garigliano">The Garigliano is a river in central Italy.It forms at the confluence of the rivers Gari (also known as the Rapido) and Liri. Garigliano is actually a deformation of "Gari-Lirano" (which in Italian means something like "Gari from the Liri"). In ancient times the whole course of the Liri and Garigliano was known as the "Liris".For the most part of its length, the Garigliano River marks the border between the Italian regions of Lazio and Campania. In medieval times, the river (then known as the "Verde") marked the southern border of the Papal States.In the 9th and early 10th centuries a band of Arabs established themselves on the banks of the Garigliano, from where they launched frequent raids on Campania and central Italy. In 915 a coalition of the pope, the Byzantines, Franks, Lombards, and Naples defeated the Garigliano Arabs in the Battle of Garigliano.In 1503 Spanish and French forces fought another battle of Garigliano, in which Piero II de' Medici was drowned, thus control of the Medici family passed to Giovanni de' Medici, later Pope Leo X. The bigger French Army was practically destroyed at little cost to the Spanish, with the remnants later surrendering at Gaeta.During the Italian Campaign of World War II, the Liri-Gari-Garigliano rivers stood at the centre of a system of German defensive lines (the most famous of which is the Gustav Line) around which the battle of Monte Cassino took place in 1943-1944. Rumours tell that the waters of the river ran red in the Cassino area during the famous battle, because of the blood of the many corpses of soldiers.From 1959 until 1982 there was a BWR nuclear power plant named "Garigliano" near the town Sessa Aurunca.

It flows southeast past Pescasseroli, Opi and Villetta Barrea and flows into the artificial lake Lago di Barrea. It then flows northeast through Alfedena, Castel di Sangro, Ateleta, Quadri, and Villa Santa Maria, before flowing into the Lago di Bomba. From there it flows northeast and joins the Aventino River, and thence into the Adriatic Sea south of Punta Cavelluccio.During World War II, the mouth of the Sangro was part of the series of German military fortifications known as the Gustav Line. The Eighth Army crossed the Sangro on 23 November 1943. This crossing was the beginning of the Allied offensive on the Winter Line defenses east of the Apennines.

  <page name="Stonehouse Creek">Stonehouse Creek, in Plymouth (England), is also known as Stonehouse Lake (on many maps) and Tinkies by the local people. The upper reaches of Stonehouse Creek, now Victoria Park, were formerly known as the Deadlake and it is frequently marked as such on early maps of the locality. This area was filled in to celebrate the 60-year reign of Queen Victoria.The lower reaches of the creek were filled in from the 1960s onwards and it is now a recreation ground and home to the Stonehouse Creek Social Club and home to Devonport High School Old Boys RFC. The club has been open since 2002, and also houses the Stonehouse Sharks Junior Rugby Club. Before any filling in or silting up, this tributary of the Tamar was tidal as far to the north east as Pennycomequick and the western end of Ford Park Cemetery.On either side of the Creek were the Royal Naval hospital and Stoke Military Hospital, patients for the naval hospital being landed at a jetty. The army hospital became the Tamar High School and Devonport High School for Boys in 1896. Only Devonport High School for Boys is still there and is now a Type 2 Academy with Headteacher Kieran Earley.

  <page name="Hollands Diep">Hollands Diep (pre-1947 spelling: Hollandsch Diep) is a wide river in the Netherlands and an estuary of the Rhine and Meuse river. Through the Scheldt-Rhine Canal it connects to the Scheldt river and Antwerp.The Bergse Maas river and the Nieuwe Merwede river join near Lage Zwaluwe to form the Hollands Diep. The Dordtsche Kil connects to it near Moerdijk. Near Numansdorp it splits into the Haringvliet and the Volkerak.The Hollands Diep was formed as a result of the extensive flooding event of 1216, which breached the dunes of Voorne and created a deep saltwater inlet (the current Haringvliet). During a second flooding event, the St. Elizabeth floods, this inlet connected to the Merwede and became an important estuary of the Rhine and Meuse rivers. From that moment on, the freshwater part of the estuary (east of the Hellegatsplein) was renamed Hollands Diep. The former river Striene, that used to connect the Meuse with the Scheldt, was completely destroyed by these flooding events and can no longer be recognised on maps.At this point where the Hollands Diep splits, there is a road traffic node on an artificial island (the Hellegatsplein), connecting to the Hoeksche Waard island on the north by the Haringvliet bridge, to the Goeree-Overflakkee on the west by the Hellegatsdam, and to the mainland on the southeast by the Volkerak Sluices.On the east side of the Hollands Diep the Moerdijk bridges connect the Dordrecht island on the north to the mainland on the south: a road bridge, a railroad bridge; a second railroad bridge has recently been constructed for the HSL-Zuid.

  <page name="Afgedamde Maas">The Afgedamde Maas (Dammed-up Meuse) is a former distributary of the Maas River (French: Meuse) in the Dutch provinces of North Brabant and Gelderland. The Maas splits near Heusden with one channel flowing north until its confluence with the river Waal (the main distributary of the river Rhine) to form the Merwede, while the other channel (the Bergse Maas) continues west as the main distributary of the Maas.The current Afgedamde Maas was created in the late Middle Ages, when a major flood made a connection between the Maas and the Merwede at the town of Woudrichem. From that moment on, the current Afgedamde Maas was the main branch of the river Maas. The former main branch eventually silted up and is today called the Oude Maasje. In the late 19th century and early 20th century the connection between the Maas and Rhine was closed off and the Maas was given a new, artificial mouth - the Bergse Maas. The resulting separation of the rivers Rhine and Maas reduced the risk of flooding and is considered to be the greatest achievement in Dutch hydraulic engineering before the completion of the Zuiderzee Works and Delta Works. The former main branch was, after the dam at its southern inlet was completed in 1904, renamed "Afgedamde Maas" and no longer receives water from the Maas.There is a car ferry, not operating on Sundays, and a foot passenger ferry.

  <page name="Haringvliet">The Haringvliet is a large inlet of the North Sea, in the province of South Holland in the Netherlands. It is an important estuary of the Rhine-Meuse delta.Near Numansdorp, the Hollands Diep splits into the Haringvliet and the Volkerak estuaries. It is closed off near Goedereede from the North Sea by the Haringvlietdam, which provides a road connection between the island of Voorne to the north and the island of Goeree-Overflakkee to the south. The dam with its sluices was built as part of the Delta Works sea barrier protection works.The Haringvliet estuary contains the island of Tiengemeten, which is separated from the river island of Hoeksche Waard by the Vuile Gat strait.The Haringvliet was formed as a result of the extensive flooding event of 1216, which breached the dunes of Voorne and created a deep saltwater inlet. During a second flooding event, the St. Elizabeth floods, this inlet connected to the Merwede and became an important estuary of the Rhine and Meuse rivers.It used to be ecologically rich, and its brackish waters, fed by both rivers and sea, supported an healthy population of seals. It also provided an access point for migrating fish like salmon and sturgeon. As a result of the North Sea flood of 1953 the Haringvliet was closed off by the Haringvlietdam. The Haringvliet lost its estuarine characteristics and became a freshwater lake. Because of that, the seals are gone and migrating fish can only enter the Rhine-Meuse Delta through the busy and heavy industrialised Nieuwe Waterweg.There are plans to permanently open a few of the Haringvliet sluices, to partly restore the ecosystem.

The Maas splits near Heusden into the Afgedamde Maas and the Bergse Maas. The Afgedamde Maas flows north until its confluence with the river Waal (the main distributary of the river Rhine) to form the Merwede, while the Bergse Maas continues west as the main distributary of the Maas. Part of the Merwede (the Nieuwe Merwede) rejoins the Bergse Maas to from the Hollands Diep estuary.Historically, a natural branch of the Maas flowed from Heusden to the Amer and Hollands Diep estuary; this branch silted up and now forms a stream called Oude Maasje. The Bergse Maas, which takes its name from the town of Geertruidenberg, was constructed in its basin to take over its functions, in 1904. The other main distributary of the Maas was at the same time dammed-up and renamed Afgedamde Maas ("Dammed-up Meuse"). The resulting separation of the rivers Rhine and Maas reduced the risk of flooding and is considered to be the greatest achievement in Dutch hydraulic engineering before the completion of the Zuiderzee Works and Delta Works.There are two road bridges and three car ferries. The latter are free of charge, as promised to the people living in the area when the Bergse Maas was dug, but as of 2004, a fee of €1.00 is charged for cars. For pedestrians, the ferries remain free of charge.

At Noresund he found inspiration for one of his most famous poems, "The Old Master" ("den gamle Mester").The first element is the name of the farm Nore (Norse "Nórar"), the last element is "sund" n 'sound, strait'. The name of the farm is the plural of "nór" n 'narrow strait' - so the meaning of the name "Noresund" is 'strait-strait'. The actual strait divides Lake Krøderen in two parts (Upper K. and Lower K.). The farm Nore has also given name to the mountain Norefjell.

  <page name="Hawke Bay">Hawke Bay is a large bay on the east coast of the North Island of New Zealand. It stretches from Mahia Peninsula in the northeast to Cape Kidnappers in the southwest, a distance of some 100 kilometres.Captain James Cook, sailing in HM Bark Endeavour, sailed into the bay on 12 October 1769. After exploring it, he named it for Sir Edward Hawke, First Lord of the Admiralty, on 15 October 1769, describing it as some 13 leagues (about 40 miles) across.This part of the New Zealand coast is subject to tectonic uplift, with the land being raised out of the sea. For this reason, the coastal land in this area has significant marine deposits, with both marine and land dinosaur fossils having been found inland. The Napier earthquake of 3 February 1931 resulted in several parts of the seabed close to the city of Napier being raised above sea level.Because the central mountain ranges come close to the coast at the north end of the bay, much of the bay's northerly coastline has deeply eroded tablelands that end in steep seaside cliffs which descend to narrow beaches.The town of Wairoa lies to the north end of the bay, at the mouth of the Wairoa River and its flood plain, while the port city of Napier lies on the coast, and near the southern end of the bay sits the city of Hastings, on the edge of another flat river flood plain.The Hawke's Bay region, as distinct from the bay itself, lies on the coastal land around the bay and also in the hinterland to the south. The bay is named "Hawke Bay", whereas the region bears the bay's former name, "Hawke's Bay".

  <page name="Lielupe">The Lielupe (in Latvian literally: "Large River", ) is a river in central Latvia. Its length is 119 km (the length would reach 310 km if the Mēmele River were counted as part of the Lielupe). The surface area of its drainage basin is 17,600 km². The average fall of the Lielupe is about (.1 meter/kilometer) and its average flow is 106 m³/s, although a maximum of 1380 m³/s has been reached during floods.The Lielupe begins at the confluence of the Mēmele and Mūsa rivers near Bauska. For the upper part of its course, the river flows through a dolomite valley with a few small rapids, until it reaches Mežotne, where it widens and deepens over the flat Zemgale Plain. For many years the Lielupe would frequently overflow its shallow banks and flood surrounding fields and villages, particularly during the spring thaw. Today many parts of the Lielupe's banks are contained with earthen dikes to prevent disastrous floods. Much of the Lielupe is covered in river grasses. At its lower reaches, the river flows parallel to the coast line of the Gulf of Riga; the city of Jūrmala stretches for almost 30 km between the river and the sea. Eventually the Lielupe flows into the Baltic Sea, while the Buļļupe branch () flows into the Daugava River. The modern mouth of the river appeared in 1755. Before then the Buļļupe was the Lielupe's main channel.About 50-55% of the water discharge of the river is from melted snow.

With the thrust of Davao City towards Information Technology and IT-Enabled Services (ITES), Davao City and the Davao Gulf area have also earned the moniker Silicon Gulf.The gulf water is regarded as one of the most diverse cetacean habitats in the nation, being home for at least 10 species of toothed whales and dolphins such as Sperm Whales and Beaked Whales. Also Whale Sharks are seen frequently. Furthermore, several ecological phenomena have been observed in the Davao Gulf such as a previously unknown predator of the Crown-of-Thorns starfish, new species records and species discoveries underlining the uniqueness of the marine resources in the Davao Gulf.

  <page name="Thapsus">Thapsus or Thapsos (less commonly, Tapsus) () was an ancient city in what is modern-day Tunisia.Originally founded by Phoenicians, it served as a marketplace on the coast of the province Byzacena in Africa Propria. Thapsus was established near a salt lake on a point of land eighty stadia (14.8 km) from the island of Lampedusa.In 46 BC, Julius Caesar defeated Metellus Scipio and the Numidian Berber King Juba I with a tremendous loss of men near Thapsus (see Battle of Thapsus). Caesar exacted a payment of sesterces from the vanquished. Their defeat marked the end of opposition to Caesar in Africa. Thapsus then became a Roman colony. Later, it was part of the Roman province of Byzacena.Thapsus became a Christian bishopric, probably a suffragan, but no Metropolitan is known. Its only known bishop is Vigilius, the author of several controversial works against the Arians and the Eutychians. He was one of the Catholic bishops whom king Hunneric of the Vandals summoned to his court in Carthage in 484 and then exiled.Its ruins exist at Ras Dimas, a promontory near Bekalta, approximately 200 km southeast of Carthage. They include an amphitheatre and various mosaics.The see, no longer residential, is included in the Catholic Church's list of titular sees. It is a Latin title, of the lowest (episcopal) rank, with one archiepiscopal exception.Since at creation as such in 1914, it has the following near-consecutive incumbents:

  <page name="Loma Prieta">Loma Prieta (from Spanish "loma" -hill, "prieta" -dark) is a Northern California mountain in the Santa Cruz Mountains. The peak is on private property about west of Morgan Hill in Santa Clara County. The dirt road to the summit is gated, but the tower maintainers generally do not mind hikers.A rural area south and east of the summit is sometimes referred to as Casa Loma, named for an unpaved road through the area. The name is unofficial, but its use is supported by the existence of a Casa Loma Volunteer Fire Department in the area. Loma Chiquita Road also serves this general area near the Santa Cruz County line.From 1976 through 1990 amateur astronomer Donald Machholz set up his telescope an average of 120 times a year on the south slope of this mountain to search for comets. From this site he discovered three new comets that bear his name, including Periodic Comet Machholz 1 96P/Machholz on May 12, 1986.The first official West Coast Messier marathon was conducted from this site in March 1979.The epicenter of the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake was near the mountain.The mountain was the longtime site for the transmitter tower of San Jose television station KNTV (from 1955 to 2005). It moved its transmitter northwest to San Bruno Mountain in September 2005, after it became the Bay Area's NBC affiliate.Loma Prieta is the tallest peak in the Santa Cruz Mountains and thus it is common to see snow on the mountain during the winter.

It is 246 meters (807 ft) tall, second in Mexico only to the Cascada de Piedra Volada (Flying Stone Falls).Basaseachic Falls is located in the high mountains of the Sierra Madre Occidental, in the Municipality of Ocampo, from Basaseachi community and about west of Chihuahua. It is reached via Federal Highway 16 and its surroundings make up the Basaseachic Falls National Park (Parque Nacional Cascada de Basaseachic).The waterfall is made by two streams, Arroyo del Durazno and Arroyo de Basaseachic, which merge in the high mountains and then fall down the canyon wall. Past the falls, the stream is called Río Candameña (Candamena River), which is the namesake of the canyon it flows through, Candamena Canyon (Cañon Candameña). Candamena River contributes to the formation of Río Mayo (Mayo River).Basaseachic Falls was considered the tallest waterfall in México until the measurement in September, 1994 of the Cascada de Piedra Volada. Both of these waterfalls are seasonal, drying up in the Spring and Autumn dry seasons.

Through its two principal tributaries, the North Santiam and the South Santiam rivers, it drains a large area of the Cascade Range at the eastern side of the Willamette Valley east of Salem and Corvallis.The main course of the river is short, formed in the Willamette Valley by the confluence of the North and South Santiam rivers on the border between Linn and Marion counties approximately northeast of Albany. It flows generally west-northwest in a slow meandering course to join the Willamette from the east approximately north of Albany.Both the North and South Santiam rise in high Cascades in eastern Linn County. The Middle Santiam River joins the South Santiam where the South Santiam is impounded to form Foster Lake. The North Santiam is impounded to form the deep Detroit Lake in the Cascades. The Santiam is a major source of water supply for Salem.The Great Willamette Flood of 1861, which crested on December 2, destroyed a large number of structures and animals on prairies near its confluence with the Willamette River and south of Knox Butte.

The gulf was formed within a relatively young but now inactive Gulf of Suez Rift rift basin, dating back about 28 million years. It stretches some north by northwest, terminating at the Egyptian city of Suez and the entrance to the Suez Canal. Along the mid-line of the gulf is the boundary between Africa and Asia. The entrance of the gulf lies atop the mature Gemsa oil and gas field.The gulf occupies the northwestern arm of the Red Sea between Africa and the Sinai Peninsula. It is the third arm of the triple junction rift system, the second arm being the Gulf of Aqaba.The length of the gulf, from its mouth at the Strait of Gubal (alternate name: Strait of Jubal) to its head at the city of Suez, is , and it varies in width from .The International Hydrographic Organization defines the southern limit of the gulf as "A line running from Ras Muhammed (27°43'N) to the South point of Shadwan Island (34°02'E) and thence Westward on a parallel (27°27'N) to the coast of Africa".The gulf sedimentary basin stratigraphic section consists of prerift Paleozoic to Oligocene clastic rocks and carbonates, and synrift and postrift Miocene to Holocene clastics and evaporites.Three large oil fields are in the gulf: the El Morgan discovered in 1964, Belayim discovered in 1955, and the October Field discovered in 1977. The October Field produces from the Cretaceous Nubia Formation, the Upper Cretaceous Nezzazat Formation, the Miocene Nukhul Formation, and the Miocene Asl Member of the Upper Rudeis Formation.

  <page name="Mount Si">Mount Si (pronounced "sigh") is a mountain in the U.S. state of Washington. It lies on the western margin of the Cascade Range just above the coastal plains around Puget Sound, and towers over the nearby town of North Bend. The mountain was named after local homesteader Josiah "Uncle Si" Merritt. It was made famous in the show "Twin Peaks", which was filmed in North Bend.Only about a 45-minute drive from Seattle, the mountain is a favorite outdoor destination for residents of Puget Sound. Between 80,000 and 100,000 hikers visit the mountain annually. The land is owned by the state of Washington and has been designated a Natural Resources Conservation Area.The long Mount Si trail climbs a total of reach to the summit ridge. The summit of Mount Si can then be reached by an exposed scramble, , up the north side of the summit block which is known as the "Haystack."Mount Si is a remnant of an oceanic plate volcano and the rocks are highly metamorphosed.Mount Si figures prominently in a Prometheus story from the Snoqualmie tribe. According to the story it is the dead body of Snoqualm, the moon. Snoqualm had ordered that a rope of cedar bark be stretched between the earth and the sky. But Fox and Blue Jay went up the rope and stole the sun from Snoqualm. Snoqualm chased them down the cedar rope, but it broke and he fell to his death. Fox then let the sun free in the sky and gave fire to the people. A face like Snoqualm's is visible on the rocks near the summit.

  <page name="Camaragibe">Camaragibe (population 143.210) is a city in northeastern Brazil, in the State of Pernambuco. It lies near Recife at 8.00° South, 35.04° West.Currently, Camaragibe is run by Jorge Alexandre (from the political party PSDB, the Party of Brazilian Social Democracy) and Reginaldo Albuquerque (The Vice-mayor).The lands now belonging to the city were used as a reserve of wood, and then for sugar planting. It was populated by natives, until the arrival of Portuguese with Duarte Coelho Pereira, around 1500. After the Portuguese arrival, however, the natives were not completely driven from the area. Instead, they lived "peacefully" with the invaders.In the 16th century the city (then just an engenho) was considered one of richest in the region until the Dutch invasion in 1645. At that time, the farm was burned to the ground by the natives.On 13 May 1982, Camaragibe, which was then part of the bigger city São Lourenço da Mata, was elevated to the category of city.The small city is considered among the most densely populated urban areas in the world because of the very accelerated growth that the city experienced from the emancipation until now.The main economic activities in Camaragibe are based in commerce and general industry.

The Westpeene, with Ostpeene as its longer tributary, and Kleine Peene/Teterower Peene (with a "Peene " without specification as its smaller and shorter affluent) flow into Kummerower See (Lake Kummerow), and from there as Peene proper to Anklam and into the Oder Lagoon.From Kommerower See, inclusively, to the mouth, the ground of the water is five feet an more below sea level. This makes water level and flows liable to the water level of Baltic Sea and Oder, including reverse flows.The Peene Valley is one of the largest contiguous fen regions in central Europe. Thanks to its wilderness and intact nature, the river Peene and its valley is sometimes superstitiously referred to as "the Amazon of the North".The western branch of the Oder River, which separates the island of Usedom from the German mainland, is often also called Peene, but actually is considered a part of the Baltic Sea called Peenestrom. It is one of three channels connecting the Oder Lagoon with the Bay of Pomerania of the Baltic Sea. (The other channels are the Świna and the Dziwna.)Major towns at the Peene river are Malchin, Teterow, Demmin and Anklam.Wolgast is on Peenestrom strait.

  <page name="Windward Islands">The Windward Islands are the southern, generally larger islands of the Lesser Antilles, within the West Indies. They lie south of the Leeward Islands, between latitudes 12° and 16° N and longitudes 60° and 62° W in one definition. As a group they start from Dominica and reach southward to the North of Trinidad &amp; Tobago.The Windward Islands are called such because they were more windward to sailing ships arriving to the New World than the Leeward Islands, given that the prevailing trade winds in the West Indies blow east to west. The trans-Atlantic currents and winds that provided the fastest route across the ocean brought these ships to the rough dividing line between the Windward and Leeward islands.Dominica is the dividing line between the Windward and Leeward islands. Guadeloupe and the islands to the south were designated "Windward Islands". Later on, all islands north of Martinique became known as the "Leeward Islands".Vessels in the Atlantic slave trade departing from the British Gold Coast and Gulf of Guinea in Africa would first encounter the southeasternmost "Windward" islands of the Lesser Antilles in their west-northwesterly heading to final destinations in the Caribbean and North and Central America. The chain of Windward Islands forms a part of the easternmost boundary of the Caribbean Sea.Most of the present "Windward Islands" were once colonial island territories of France, also known as the French Antilles.The Windward Islands are:

The settlement is built in the hollow (micro valley of the "Kaluđerički potok" creek), with a specific microclimate, so out of all parts of Belgrade Kaluđerica is often the foggiest and the first one to have snow in winter. In modern Serbian, word "kaluđerica" means a "nun", though the name was probably derived from the word "kaluđer" which means a "monk" (kaluđerica - a monk's place).A significant part of the settlement of 100,000 is built without any permits and plans. Kaluđerica lacks sewage infrastructure or and has poor transportation (short and bending streets, with only one straight street in the settlement, and two bus lines of the public transportation, 309 and 301N).As Kaluđerica rapidly developed, several distinct sub-neighborhoods within the settlement were formed. Those to the north, along the "Smederevski put", are mostly named after the kafanas which had been the only features on the road before the settlement expanded.Serbian folk singer Mira Škorić is born in Kaluđerica.Serbian singer Sandra Afrika is born in Kaluđerica.

  <page name="Emmeloord">Emmeloord is the administrative center of the municipality of Noordoostpolder, Flevoland, Netherlands.At the heart of the Noordoostpolder, where the three main drainage canals intersect, is the city of Emmeloord (1943). Emmeloord is in a polder: land reclaimed from the IJsselmeer, which earlier was part of the sea. Planned from the outset to be the first and the only major town of the polder, it is the local governmental and services centre. Ten smaller villages, conceived more as agricultural communities, were planned in a wide circle around Emmeloord, with the distances between them determined to be easily reachable by bicycle. The first settlements were Ens, Marknesse and Kraggenburg (1949), then Bant (1951), then Creil and Rutten (1953), and finally Espel, Tollebeek and Nagele (1956). There is another village called Luttelgeest (located northeast in the Noordoostpolder). From Emmeloord three canals take their water to three pumping stations, the "Buma" near Lemmer, the "Smeenge" at Vollenhove and the "Vissering" on Urk.Emmeloord was named after an abandoned village on the island of Schokland.In the center of Emmeloord there is a watertower called the Poldertoren. The tower is the central point of the Noordoostpolder and could be seen from almost every location in the early years of the Noordoostpolder, when there were no tall trees. In Japan there is a replica of this watertower.For history see Zuiderzee Works.There is no railway station in Emmeloord, but the following are a few suggestions also showing possible major destination. Bus Times can be found at this link .Emmeloord lies at the intersection of the A6 motorway and the N50 highway, providing a rapid connection to Amsterdam, Zwolle and Friesland.

  <page name="Cemetery of the Evergreens">The Cemetery of the Evergreens is a non-denominational cemetery in Brooklyn and Queens, New York, colloquially called Evergreen Cemetery. It was incorporated in 1849, not long after the passage of New York's Rural Cemetery Act spurred development of cemeteries outside Manhattan. For a time, it was the busiest cemetery in New York City; in 1929 there were 4,673 interments. The cemetery borders Brooklyn and Queens and covers of rolling hills and gently sloping meadows. It features several thousand trees and flowering shrubs in a park-like setting. The Evergreens is the final resting place of more than 526,000 people.The Evergreens was built on the principle of the rural cemetery. Two of the era's most noted landscape architects, Andrew Jackson Downing and Alexander Jackson Davis, were instrumental in the layout of the cemetery grounds.The Evergreens has a monument to eight unidentified victims of the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire of March 25, 1911. In 2011, researchers were able to provide names to these last eight dead.There are also 17 British Commonwealth service personnel buried in the cemetery, 13 from World War I and 4 from World War II.The cemetery was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on November 15, 2007. Cypress Hills Cemetery lies to its northwest.

  <page name="Koos">Koos is the largest of several small islands in the Bay of Greifswald, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany. It has an area of 772 hectares and a maximum elevation of just above three meters. The island is a largely uninhabited natural reserve with restricted access. It is separated from the mainland by "Kooser Bucht" and "Kooser See", two bays connected by a tiny strait, "Beek".In 1241, Barnuta, prince of Rügen, granted Koos (then ""Chosten"") to Eldena abbey (then ""Hilda""), later it became a possession of the Hanseatic town of Greifswald, located a few kilometers southward. A medieval burgh has been suggested on the isle, but not verified. A 17th-century Dutch settlement had disappeared in the 18th century. Koos is administered by the nearby town of Greifswald.

  <page name="Mansfield Dam">Mansfield Dam (formerly Marshall Ford Dam) is a dam located across a canyon at Marshall Ford on the Colorado River, northwest of Austin, Texas. The groundbreaking ceremony occurred on February 19, 1937, with United States Secretary of the Interior Harold L. Ickes attending. The dam was a joint project by the Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) and the United States Bureau of Reclamation, with the company Brown and Root the prime contractor. The dam was completed in 1941. Originally called Marshall Ford Dam, the name was changed in 1941 in honor of United States Representative J.J. Mansfield. The reservoir behind Mansfield Dam is named Lake Travis. The dam is owned and operated by the LCRA.Mansfield Dam is high, long, and thick at the base. The concrete gravity dam with embankment wings and saddle dikes was designed to control flooding; to store 1.4 km³ (369 billion US gallons) of water; and to generate hydroelectric power (108 megawatts). The Spillway Elevation is 714 feet above MSL. LCRA begins to open floods gates when water reaches 681 feet above MSL.A two-lane highway, RM 620, crossed the top of the dam, but traffic congestion brought on by the growth of the city of Austin and expanded popularity of recreation at Lake Travis forced the state to build a four-lane highway bridge on the downstream side of the dam. Traffic is no longer allowed on the road across the dam, except for service vehicles.

  <page name="Arguineguín">Arguineguín (Guanche for "quiet water") is one of the most populated towns along the south coast of Gran Canaria, Spain. A typical Canarian fishing village, it is home to many locals rather than being a tourist resort. It is part of the municipality of Mogán and is located southwest of Las Palmas.There are several bars and restaurants, the latter specialising in fresh fish caught the same day. Tuesday is market day (the largest on the island). Arguineguín features a beach and a port. Tourism is not as popular in Arguineguín as in the larger places as Maspalomas and Playa del Ingles. Holiday hotels, however, can be found in Arguineguín; Marino I, Dorado Beach, Club Puerto Atlantico, Sunwing Resort Arguineguín, Green Beach Hotel and Radisson Blu Resort to mention the larger ones.The Norwegians have especially taken the fishing village into their hearts, and the Norwegian population is quite large in the winter time. This might also be due to the Norwegian school, Norwegian church and a Norwegian health center being located in or just outside Arguineguín. There is also a Norwegian doctor's office - located at the marketplace in Arguineguín - and a big Norwegian-owned timeshare holiday resort named Anfi del Mar, located just outside Arguineguín.The harbour here hosts a ferry service to Puerto Rico de Gran Canaria and Puerto de Mogán whilst another popular way to reach the town from Puerto Rico de Gran Canaria is by trekking over the mountain between the two towns.The town also lies on several public bus routes offering convenient service to other towns on the island.Arguineguín is also served by an expressway (GC1) with a nearby interchange and a highway.

The village is located on the shore of the lake Frøylandsvatnet, about east of the village of Kleppe and about southwest of the village of Orstad. The village is named after the Klepp Station, a station on the Jæren railway line.When the Jæren Line was constructed in 1878, the village of Kleppe was somewhat offset from the convenient path of the railway, so the railway station serving Kleppe was placed east of the village rather than in the village. After the station was built, the village of "Klepp Stasjon" (literally "Klepp Station") grew up around the railway station.

  <page name="Gran Paradiso">The Gran Paradiso () is a mountain in the Graian Alps located between the Aosta Valley and Piedmont regions of north-west Italy.The peak, the 7th highest mountain in the Graian Alps, with an elevation of 4,061 m, is close to Mont Blanc on the nearby border with France. In the SOIUSA ("International Standardized Mountain Subdivision of the Alps") the mountain belongs to an alpine subsection called ""North-Eastern Graian Alps"" (It:"Alpi del Gran Paradiso"; Fr:"Alpes du Grand-Paradis") and also gives its name to the "gruppo del Gran Paradiso".While the Mont Blanc massif straddles the border between France and Italy, the Gran Paradiso is the only mountain whose summit reaches over 4,000 metres that is entirely within Italian territory.The summit was first reached on September 4, 1860 by J. J. Cowell, W. Dundas, J. Payot and J. Tairraz. By high Alpine mountaineering standards, Gran Paradiso is considered one of the least difficult 4,000 meter peaks, although it has one of the highest ascents of 1,300 meters on the summit day. The final 60 meters cover rocky terrain and require mountaineering skills. Climbs normally start from either the Refuge Frédéric Chabod or the Refuge Victor-Emmanuel II. The latter is named after Victor Emmanuel II of Italy who created the Gran Paradiso royal reserve in 1856, presently the site of the Gran Paradiso National Park.Gran Paradiso is located in the Gran Paradiso National Park, an Italian national park named after the mountain. On the French side of the border, the park is continued by the Vanoise National Park.

  <page name="Hollandse IJssel">The Hollandse (or Hollandsche) IJssel ("Holland IJssel", as opposed to the 'regular' or Gelderland IJssel) is a branch of the Rhine delta that flows westward from Nieuwegein on river Lek through IJsselstein, Gouda and Capelle aan den IJssel to Krimpen aan den IJssel, where it ends in the Nieuwe Maas. Another branch called Enge IJssel ("Narrow IJssel") flows southwest from Nieuwegein. The name IJssel is thought to derive from the Germanic "i sala", meaning "dark water". Originally, the Hollandse IJssel forked off from river Lek at Nieuwegein, but the connection was cut off with the Hollandse IJssel nowadays only draining the surrounding pastures.The first part of the Delta Works sea protection constructions was built at the mouth of the Hollandse IJssel in 1957.

  <page name="Bismarck Archipelago">The Bismarck Archipelago is a group of islands off the northeastern coast of New Guinea in the western Pacific Ocean and is part of the Islands Region of Papua New Guinea. Its area is about 50,000 square km.The first inhabitants of the archipelago arrived around 33,000 years ago from New Guinea, either by boats across the Bismarck Sea or via a temporary land bridge, created by an uplift in the Earth's crust. Later arrivals included the Lapita people.The first European to visit these islands was Dutch explorer Willem Schouten in 1616. The islands remained unsettled by western Europeans until they were annexed as part of the German protectorate of German New Guinea in 1884. The area was named in honour of the Chancellor Otto von Bismarck.On 13 March 1888, a volcano erupted on Ritter Island causing a megatsunami. Almost the entire volcano fell into the ocean, leaving a small crater lake.Following the outbreak of World War I, the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force seized the islands in 1914 and Australia later received a League of Nations mandate for the islands. They remained under Australian administration—interrupted only by Japanese occupation during World War II—until Papua New Guinea became independent in September 1975.The Bismarck Archipelago includes mostly volcanic islands with a total land area of . The archipelago encompasses the Bismarck Sea and sits upon the North Bismarck Plate, the Manus Plate and the South Bismarck Plate.Islands are grouped here according to administrative province:The passage of water between the islands of New Britain and New Ireland is called St. George's Channel after St. George's Channel in the British Isles between Wales and Ireland.

  <page name="Jerichower Land">Jerichower Land is a district ("Kreis") in the north-east of Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. Its neighbouring administrative units are (clockwise from the south): the districts of Anhalt-Bitterfeld, Salzlandkreis, the city of Magdeburg, the districts of Börde, Stendal, Havelland and Potsdam-Mittelmark in Brandenburg.In 1816, the area of the district became part of the Prussian province of Saxony, and was split administratively into three districts, Jerichow I, Jerichow II and Ziesar. The district of Ziesar was added into Jerichow I in 1826.After World War II, the districts were rearranged. Some areas of the two districts were added to the neighbouring districts of Havelberg, Rathenow, Brandenburg, Loburg and Zerbst. The two districts were also renamed after their administrative seats, thus Jerichow I became "District Burg", and Jerichow II became "District Genthin". In 1952, the district of Burg was split into two parts. However, in 1957, the district of Loburg was recombined with the district of Burg.In 1994, the two districts of Burg and Genthin were merged, and re-adopted the historical name of Jerichow. In 2007, 6 municipalities from the former district of Anhalt-Zerbst (Hobeck, Lohburg, Lübs, Prödel, Rosian and Schweinitz) were added to Jerichower Land District.The name of the district derives from the city of Jerichow, the name of which is related to that of an early Slavic tribal grouping. It is not related to the name for the city of Jericho in the Middle East.Main water bodies in the district are the rivers Elbe, Ehle, Ihle and Nuthe as well as the Elbe-Havel canal.The vertical bars in the left half of the coat of arms symbolize the Elbe-Havel canal, while the crane in the right symbolizes the nature in the district. Cranes are common birds in the district.The district Jerichower Land consists of the following subdivisions:

Situated at the point where Lake Geneva empties into the Rhône, it is visible throughout the city and from the air, even when flying over Geneva at an altitude of .The first Jet d'Eau was installed in 1886 at the Usine de la Coulouvrenière, a little further downstream from its present location. It was used as a safety valve for a hydraulic power network and could reach a height of about 30 metres (98 feet). In 1891, its aesthetic value was recognised and it was moved to its present location to celebrate the Federal Gymnastics Festival and the 600th anniversary of the Swiss Confederation, on which occasion it was operated for the first time. Its maximum height was about 90 metres (295 feet). The present Jet d'Eau was installed in 1951 in a partially submerged pumping station to pump lake water instead of city water.Since 2003, the fountain has operated during the day all year round, except in case of frost and particularly strong wind. It also operates in the evening between spring and autumn and is lit by a set of 21 lights totalling 9 kW.On 25 August 2016, the fountain celebrated its 125th anniversary at its present location.

  <page name="Strait of Canso">The Strait of Canso (also Gut of Canso or Canso Strait, also called Straits of Canceau or Canseaux until the early 20th century), is a strait located in the province of Nova Scotia, Canada. It divides the Nova Scotia peninsula from Cape Breton Island.It is a long thin channel approximately 27 kilometres long and averaging 3 kilometers wide (1 km at its narrowest). The strait connects Chedabucto Bay on the Atlantic Ocean to St. George's Bay on the Northumberland Strait, a sub basin of the Gulf of St. Lawrence.The strait is extremely deep (200+ feet) with two major communities at Port Hawkesbury on the eastern side facing Mulgrave on the western side, both ports. The strait is crossed by the Canso Causeway for vehicular and rail traffic, opened in 1955. The Canso Canal allows ships to pass through the causeway, and this can accommodate any vessel capable of transiting the St. Lawrence Seaway.An account of early settlement in the area is given in the letters of local resident Henry Nicholas Paint (1830-1921), Member of Parliament for Richmond county and merchant, whose father Nicholas secured valuable land grants and settled in a stone-built house at Belle Vue in 1817. Port Hawkesbury, at first known as Ship harbour, emerged as a shipbuilding and boatbuilding port on the Strait in the 19th century with firms such as H.W. Embree and Sons producing distinctive fishing boats that came to be known as "Canso Boats" after the Strait.

  <page name="Misti">Misti, also known as Putina or Wawa Putina "(Guagua Putina)",is a stratovolcano of andesite, dacite and rhyolite located in southern Peru near the city of Arequipa. With its seasonally snow-capped, symmetrical cone, Misti stands at above sea level and lies between mount Chachani () and Pichu Pichu volcano (). Its last eruption was in 1985, 198 years after its previous documented eruption.Misti has three concentric craters. In the inner crater fumarole activity can be seen. Near the inner crater six Inca mummies and rare Inca artifacts were found in 1998 during a month-long excavation directed by archaeologists Johan Reinhard and Jose Antonio Chavez. These findings are currently stored at the "Museo de Santuarios Andinos" in Arequipa.There are two main climbing routes on the volcano. The Pastores route starts at . Usually a camp is made at at Nido de Aguilas. The Aguada Blanca route starts at near the Aguada Blanca reservoir, and a camp is made at at Monte Blanco (the camp is named after Mont Blanc, the summit of which is approximately the same elevation as the camp). Neither climbing routes presents technical difficulties, but both are considered strenuous because of the steep loose sand slopes.

  <page name="Desventuradas Islands">The Desventuradas Islands, also known as Islas de los Desventurados, () is a group of four small islands located off the coast of Chile, northwest of Santiago in the Pacific Ocean. They are considered part of Insular Chile.The vegetation is a miniature mosaic of matorral, barren rock, various size trees, and shrubs mixed with ferns and perennial herbs.There are no permanent sources of fresh water on the islands. Vertebrates inhabiting both islands are limited to birds. Ten species of marine birds and one land bird species, some of them endangered, make their nests on or visit the islands.Because of their isolation and difficulty of access, there are no human settlements on these islands, but a detachment of the Chilean Navy is stationed on "Isla San Félix," which also hosts the Isla San Felix Airport (ICAO code for the airfield: SCFX).The islands were first sighted by Juan Fernández on 6 November 1574 while voyaging from Callao to Valparaíso, and perhaps earlier by Ferdinand Magellan in 1520. Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa wrote in 1579 that "they are now called after St. Felix and St. Ambor (i.e. Felix and Nabor)". However, the name of the martyr Ambor (Nabor) became confused with that of the more famous bishop Saint Ambrose (San Ambrosio).It is, probably, one of these islands that Captain John Davis struck one night in 1686. He was able to continue his voyage but, erroneously reported the position of the incident.San Felix played a part in the Falklands War. In May 1982, the Chilean government allowed RAF Nimrod MR2s to fly maritime reconnaissance sorties from the island, gathering information on the movements of the Argentine Navy.The Desventuradas Islands, from east to west:

It covers an area of and had a population of 2,951 in 1,333 households at the 2001 census, the population increasing to 3,149 at the 2011 Census. It lies within the Norfolk Broads, about north-east of Norwich on the A149 road.For the purposes of local government, it falls within the district of North Norfolk. However, those parts of the parish lying adjacent to the river fall into the executive area of the Broads Authority.Stalham was once served by a railway station until it was closed in 1959. The nearest railway station is now Worstead.Through the 1960s Stalham's economy sank from a reduction of the agricultural labour force as a result of improvements in agricultural technology. Beginning in the 1970s, though, housing developments attracted people who took up residence in Stalham but worked elsewhere.The Museum of the Broads moved to Stalham in 2000 and is situated on Stalham Staithe. It 'aims to bring the history of the Broads alive for locals and visitors to Norfolk' and is open to the public throughout the summer.In 2002 Tesco built a supermarket in Stalham, with considerable controversy, with many residents fearing that it would "kill the high street".Stalham is part of the electoral ward called Stalham and Sutton. The total population of this ward at the 2011 Census was 4,312.

The Carson and Sierra Nevada mountains together cast a rain shadow over the Greater Reno Area and Carson City.Unlike the Sierra Nevada Mountains to the west of Lake Tahoe, the Carson Range loses its snow much earlier (April), and gains it much later (December). In fact, it receives about half the snowfall as mountains west of the lake. Meltwater from the range feeds into the Truckee River and West Fork Carson River, as well as Lake Tahoe and Marlette Lake.The western slopes of the range form the eastern shoreline of Lake Tahoe, along which US 50 and NV 28 form a partial ring road around Lake Tahoe.Travel between Lake Tahoe and Carson City is possible via US 50 over Spooner Summit, or NV 207 over Daggett Pass. Winding through the northern half of the range lies NV 431, connecting Incline Village to Reno over Mount Rose Summit.The Tahoe Rim Trail traverses this mountain range.

  <page name="Strokkur">Strokkur (Icelandic for "churn") is a fountain geyser located in a geothermal area beside the Hvítá River in Iceland in the southwest part of the country, east of Reykjavík. It is one of Iceland's most famous geysers, erupting once every 6–10 minutes. Its usual height is 15–20 m, although it can sometimes erupt up to 40 m high.Strokkur belongs to the Haukadalur valley area, where various other geothermal feature such as mud pools, fumaroles and other geysers are located around it, such as the famous Geysir geyser.Strokkur was first mentioned in 1789, after an earthquake helped to unblock the conduit of the geyser. Its activity fluctuated throughout the 19th century; in 1815 its height was estimated to have been as much as 60 metres. It continued to erupt until the turn of the 20th century, until another earthquake blocked the conduit again. In 1963, upon the advice of the Geysir Committee, locals cleaned out the blocked conduit through the bottom of the basin, and the geyser has been regularly erupting ever since.Strokkur and its surrounding areas regularly attract tourists hoping to see the geyser erupt, as it is one of a very few natural geysers to erupt frequently and reliably.

  <page name="Surigao Strait">Surigao Strait (Filipino: "Kipot ng Surigaw") is a strait in the southern Philippines, between the Bohol Sea and the Leyte Gulf of the Philippine Sea.It is located between the regions of Visayas and Mindanao. It lies between northern Mindanao Island and Panaon Island, and between the Dinagat Islands and Leyte island.The strait is deep but has a strong current, up to . The northern entrance of the Surigao Strait is marked by a navigation light on Suluan Island.It is regularly crossed by numerous ferries that transport goods and people between Visayas and Mindanao. The ferries stop at Liloan, Southern Leyte and Surigao City in Surigao del Norte.According to legend, the strait was named after Solibao, a Negrito chieftain, who lived at the outlet of the Surigao River. Migrating Visayan fishermen gradually formed a settlement there, and when Spanish explorers visited the place, they probably misheard the name as Surigao instead of Solibao. A different theory explains that Surigao may be derived from the Spanish word "surgir", meaning "swift water" or "current".In March 1521 during the first circumnavigation of the Earth, Ferdinand Magellan and his crew were the first Europeans to sail through the strait.The Battle of Surigao Strait took place here on October 25, 1944, when the "cross the T" incident took place as American battleships fired their guns over Vice Admiral Shoji Nishimura's Southern Force; nearly all of which, including the battleships "Yamashiro" and "Fusō" and others were sunk. Admiral Nishimura was killed in action when his flagship "Yamashiro" sank following actions against Jesse B. Oldendorf's battleships, all but one of which had been at Pearl Harbor.

  <page name="River Piddle">The River Piddle or Trent or North River is a small rural Dorset river which rises next to Alton Pancras church. Alton Pancras was originally named Awultune, a Saxon name meaning the village at the source of a river. The river's name has Germanic origins and has had various spellings over the years. In AD 966 it was called the 'Pidelen', and on the church tower at Piddletrenthide—the first village to which it gives its name—it is spelled 'Pydel'. Several villages which the river passes through are named after it: as well as Piddletrenthide there are Piddlehinton, Puddletown, Tolpuddle, Affpuddle, Briantspuddle and Turnerspuddle. Local legend tells that the Victorians changed the spelling to 'Puddle', due to 'piddle' being an alternative word for 'piss', (although Puddletown was still called Piddletown into the 1950s), but see for instance the John Speed map of the county from 1610 which has the name 'Puddletown'.The Piddle flows south and then south-easterly more or less parallel with its bigger neighbour, the River Frome, to Wareham, where they both enter Poole Harbour via Wareham Channel.&lt;BR&gt;

It includes Cathedral Peak, Unicorn Peak, Eichorn Pinnacle, Echo Peaks, Echo Ridge, Matthes Crest, and Cockscomb. The mountains were formed by glaciers carving out the granite material. The tops of the peaks in the range were above the level of the highest glaciation, and are therefore un-eroded and distinctly spire-like. The range is named after Cathedral Peak, which resembles a cathedral spire.The range runs beside the two Cathedral Lakes, just one mile southwest of Cathedral Peak.

  <page name="Mount Eccles">Mount Eccles is an inactive volcano in southwestern Victoria, Australia near Macarthur. The Gunditjmara name for the mountain is Budj Bim meaning "High Head". The roughly conical shaped peak rises . The peak is a scoria hill that was thrown up beside a group of three overlapping volcanic craters that now contain Lake Surprise. A line of smaller craters and scoria cones runs to the southeast. Lava flows extend to form a shield volcano and are fed by several lava channels, or "lava canals" as they are known locally.Initial estimates of the age of the eruption were all "minimum ages" from swamps that formed some time after the eruption and ranged from 6000 to 27,000 years, but the latest evidence suggests that the eruption was at least 30,000 years ago (using dated sediments in the floor of the Lake Surprise crater) and could have been as old as 40,000 for the Tyrendarra lava flow.Mount Eccles is the source of the Tyrendarra lava flow that extends to the southwest. The eruptions altered the drainage in the area producing wetlands of the Budj Bim National Heritage Landscape.The mountain was named Mount Eeles in 1836 by Major Thomas Mitchell after William Eeles of the 95th Regiment of Foot who fought with Mitchell in the Peninsular War. A draftsman's error meant that the name was rendered "Eccles" from 1845.Mount Eccles National Park at Lake Surprise encompasses and includes many interesting geologic features such as lava flows, lava caves, scoria cones and crater lakes. The park has a campground and the base of the vents supports Lake Surprise, which is generally closed for swimming due to blue-green algae issues. The dreaming of local Koori nations incorporates tales of volcanic eruptions from the past. Mount Napier is located northeast of Mount Eccles.

During major eruptions, water may be thrown more than 300 feet (91.44 m) into the air.Steamboat's major eruptions last from 3 to 40 minutes, and are followed by powerful jets of steam. Steamboat does not erupt on a predictable schedule, with recorded intervals between major eruptions ranging from four days to fifty years. The geyser was dormant from 1911 to 1961. Minor eruptions of 10 to 15 feet (3–5 m) are much more frequent. After an eruption, the geyser often vents large amounts of steam for up to 48 hours. Cistern Spring, located nearby, will drain completely during a major eruption of the geyser; the spring refills within a few days.Prior to 1904, Waimangu Geyser, in New Zealand, had some taller eruptions capable of reaching , but in 1904, a landslide changed the local water table, and since then, Waimangu has not erupted. Excelsior Geyser in Yellowstone's Midway Geyser Basin likewise was taller, with eruptions reaching . However, Excelsior has not erupted since 1985, and is now classified as a hot spring.The last eruption of Steamboat Geyser occurred on 3 September 2014. The last ten major eruptions were on the following dates:Steamboat Geyser has two vents, a northern and a southern, approximately five meters apart.

  <page name="Valle Maggia">Valle Maggia (Maggia Valley) is an alpine valley of the Maggia River in Ticino, the Italian canton of Switzerland.The valley is dotted with small picturesque villages with traditional stone houses, vineyards and dairy farms. In the mid-19th century due to food shortage, economic hardship and an unsustainable population, many families emigrated to Australia and the Americas.For example, the villages of Lodano and Giumaglio presently have a combined population of around 200 people as compared to 500 in the 19th century. The largest industries of the valley after tourism are stone quarrying and dairy production.The road from Locarno through the valley leads to others: the Valley of Bosco/Gurin, Val Lavizzara, Val di Campo, Val Bavona, Valle di Peccia, Val Sambuco, all part of the Vallemaggia district.Tall waterfalls are a common sight in the valley as many mountain streams feed the Maggia River throughout its course. In a distance of less than 40 kilometers the Maggia River runs from the foot of an alpine glacier to Lake Maggiore. Beginning with tundra plants at its source and finishing with tropical palm trees at its mouth.Vallemaggia (district)

  <page name="Buchanan Dam">The Buchanan Dam () is a multiple arch dam located on the Colorado River of Texas. The dam forms Lake Buchanan and was the first dam to be completed in the chain of Texas Highland Lakes. The dam is used for generating hydroelectric power and for flood control and is located about west of Burnet, Texas.Construction of the then-named George W. Hamilton Dam was started in 1931 by a company controlled by Samuel Insull, but soon ended with the dam less than half completed when his highly leveraged public utility holding company collapsed during the Great Depression. In 1934, the Texas legislature authorized the formation of the Lower Colorado River Authority to complete the Hamilton dam. Following completion in 1937, the dam was renamed for U.S. Representative James P. Buchanan, who was involved obtaining federal funding the project from the Public Works Administration.Construction of the dam required the relocation of the town of Bluffton, Texas. Relocation began in 1931 and was complete by 1939. A 2011 drought re-exposed the old Bluffton townsite.Following a flood along the river in 1938, in which the dam was required to pass through all of the flow of water, there was criticism of the dam project as failing to meet its promise of preventing downstream floods. However, at the time it was pointed out that the Buchanan Dam was just the first in a series of four flood control dams, and that prevention of flooding would not be possible until they were finished.

There was also a corn and saw mill at Hope, driven by an 11 ft water wheel.At Brough there were a number of mills that used the Noe, including a lace-thread doubling mill, a cotton mill and the corn mill (pictured). The corn mill is notable in that water powered milling came to an end in 1954, when the flow of the Noe was reduced by the upstream diversion scheme. This was constructed to provide additional inflows for Ladybower Reservoir by the Derwent Valley Water Board.

  <page name="Siletz Reservation">The Siletz Reservation is a 5.852 sq mi (15.157 km²) Indian reservation in Lincoln County, Oregon, United States, owned by the Confederated Tribes of Siletz. The reservation lies on numerous non-contiguous parcels of land in east-central Lincoln County, mostly east of the city of Siletz, between it and the Polk County line. (The city is located at (44.721812, -123.916316)).In November 1855 President of the United States Franklin Pierce issued an executive order creating a reservation for the relocation of the indigenous peoples of the coastal region of the Oregon Territory. A 120-mile-long strip of land was designated for this "Coast" or "Siletz" Reservation. This reservation extended from Cape Lookout in Tillamook County on the North coast extending all the way down to the Siltcoos River, near Florence in the South.As Oregon's population grew, the federal government opened up reservation lands for settlement by white newcomers, who displaced the indigenous peoples. Tribal groups reestablished a presence in isolated portions of their traditional homelands. Under the Dawes Act of 1887, communal tribal lands were divided for distribution of individual plots to households of tribal members; any remaining acreage was classified as "surplus" and sold to non-natives. This break-up of communal lands accelerated the process of atomization of the state's indigenous peoples.

  <page name="Japanese Alps">The is a series of mountain ranges in Japan which bisect the main island of Honshu. The name was coined by William Gowland, the "Father of Japanese Archaeology", and later popularized by Reverend Walter Weston (1861–1940), an English missionary for whom a memorial plaque is located at Kamikochi, a tourist destination known for its alpine climate. When Gowland coined the phrase, however, he was only referring to the Hida Mountains.Today, the Japanese Alps encompass the Hida Mountains, the Kiso Mountains and the Akaishi Mountains. These towering ranges include several peaks exceeding in height, the tallest after Mount Fuji. The highest are Mount Hotaka at in north area and Mount Kita at in south area. Mount Ontake is well known as an active volcano, having erupted most recently in 2014.The Northern Alps, also known as the Hida Mountains, stretch through Nagano, Toyama and Gifu prefectures. A small portion of the mountains also reach into Niigata Prefecture.The Central Alps, also known as the Kiso Mountains, lie in Nagano prefecture.The Southern Alps, also known as the Akaishi Mountains, span Nagano, Yamanashi, and Shizuoka prefectures.

  <page name="Dana Meadows">"For the activist, see Donella "Dana" Meadows."The Dana Meadows can be found at the eastern entrance to Yosemite National Park, at the foot of Mount Dana, not far from Tuolumne Meadows and the Tioga Pass entrance station. The Dana Fork of the Tuolumne River originates adjacent to the meadows, and flows west through them towards its junction with the Lyell Fork of the Tuolumne River.At an altitude of 9,728 feet (2,965 m), the meadow can be covered in snow up to 162 inches (411 cm) deep in wintertime. In June or July, it is springtime in these meadows, but snow can come at any time, especially after 1 September.Before Yosemite became a park, Basque sheepherders would graze their flocks here, and in other areas of the Sierra Nevada. Often lonely, they would carve their initials into the trees of the meadow, several of which are still visible. (In hunting season, some animals of the Sierra, such as the deer, have learned to migrate into the park.)The meadows are named for James Dwight Dana (1813–1895), a professor of geology and natural history at Yale.

  <page name="Highland Park distillery">Highland Park distillery is a Scotch whisky distillery based in Kirkwall, Orkney. It is the most northerly whisky distillery in Scotland, half a mile farther north than that at Scapa distillery.Highland Park has performed well at international spirit ratings competitions. Its 25-year single malt scotch, for example, received double gold medals at the 2007 and 2009 San Francisco World Spirits Competition.The distillery was founded in 1798, presumably by Magnus Eunson. The name of this whisky does not refer to the area of Scotland known as The Highlands, but rather to the fact that the distillery was founded on an area called 'High Park' distinguished from a lower area nearby.Highland Park is one of the few distilleries to malt its own barley, using locally cut peat from Hobbister Moor. The peat is then mixed with heather before being used as fuel. The malt is peated to a level of 20 parts per million phenol and then mixed with unpeated malt produced on the Scottish mainland.In 1984, Highland Park was the only whisky ever to have scored a rating of 100% by the regular tasting team of "The Scotsman", a national newspaper of Scotland. Whisky reviewer Michael Jackson has called it "The greatest all-rounder in the world of malt whisky."Highland Park is available in various proprietary bottlings by year, as well as a special bottling known as Cappella, available only at the distillery. In addition, several independent bottlings of Highland Park are produced. Highland Park is also one of the ingredients of The Famous Grouse blend.

  <page name="Cala Gonone">Cala Gonone is an Italian seaside town and a civil parish ("frazione") of the municipality ("comune") of Dorgali, Province of Nuoro, in the region of Sardinia. In 2007 it had 1,279 inhabitants.The area around Cala Gonone was inhabited in the Nuragic Era. The remains of a Nuragic settlement can be seen at Nuraghe Mannu on the outskirts of the village, just off the road to Dorgali. The modern village was founded by a colony of fishermen from the island of Ponza at the beginning of the 20th century. The town however remained largely isolated from the rest of Sardinia until the tunnel through the hills from Dorgali was opened in 1860.The town is situated in the Bay of Orosei on the east of the island and in the geographical region of Supramonte, 9 kilometers from Dorgali, 41 from Nuoro and 108 from Olbia. Close to the village, and reachable by the sea, is the show cave of Bue Marino. Many boats from small speedboats to large tourist boats dock in at the Bue Marino or travel further down the coast to Cala Luna to let the passengers bath in the turquoise water or explore the caves that have been hollowed out by the sea. Almost everyone that goes to the small caves writes their name in charcoal, from a small fire, on the wall, creating a huge mass of writing across several meters of the cave wall.Due to its natural environment (the territory is included in the Gennargentu National Park) and to the quality of its waters, Cala Gonone is a popular tourist venue. The beaches of the village are: the Spiaggia Centrale (central beach), S'Abba Durche, Cala Luna, Cartoe, Osalla, Cala Fuili, Sos Dorroles, S'Abba Meica, Ziu Martine and Cala Fuili.

The local economy is supported by a mix of agricultural and industrial enterprises.It is famous for one of the largest markets in South Korea, Osan Market, which has been in continuous operation since 1792. The city was the scene of brutal battles with communist forces during the Korean War in 1950 (see Battle of Osan), before being taken over by American forces soon afterwards; there is a statue dedicated to UN forces on the outskirts of the city.The United States Air Force base named after the city, Osan AB, is not actually located in the city, but is instead 8 km (5 mi) south, in the Songtan section (formerly a separate city) of Pyeongtaek.Osan Station is a large subway station located in the heart of Osan. It is part of the Seoul Subway Line 1 and the KTX. There is a bus terminal next to the subway station and many buses stop in front of the subway station.Osan came to be called by its current name in 1914, at the time of a general reorganization of local governments under Japanese rule. At that time it became Osan-myeon, part of Suwon. This name in turn was taken from that of a local stream, the Osancheon. However, prior to the Japanese occupation, the name had been rendered in hanja as 鰲山, meaning "soft-shelled turtle mountain." Because of the complexity of the 鰲 ("o") character, and because crows were abundant in the area, the Japanese changed the name to 烏山, meaning "crow mountain."Kyochon, a fried chicken chain, has its head office in Osan.

  <page name="East River Mountain Tunnel">The East River Mountain Tunnel is a vehicular tunnel that carries Interstate 77 (I-77) and U.S. Route 52 (US 52) through East River Mountain between the communities of Bluefield, West Virginia, and Rocky Gap, Virginia.Groundbreaking began on the tunnel on August 12, 1969, and after five years of labor it was opened to the public at a ribbon-cutting ceremony on December 20, 1974. At a cost of $40 million, it was (at the time) the most expensive construction project undertaken by the West Virginia Division of Highways. Because the northern end of the tunnel is in West Virginia and the southern end is in Virginia, Virginia shared the cost of the project. The state line falls almost exactly across the midpoint of the tunnel, with 51% of the tunnel residing in West Virginia and the remaining 49% on the Virginia side.Prior to the opening of the East River Mountain Tunnel, travelers wishing to cross the state line had to navigate the narrow, twisting, guardrail-less route of US 52 up and over the mountain (now designated as VA 598/WV 598). When fog or snow was present, the journey became arduous, and the road was occasionally closed completely (particularly in the winter months) due to treacherous conditions.The tunnel is located about north of its shorter cousin, the Big Walker Mountain Tunnel. The East River Mountain Tunnel is also one of only two land vehicular tunnels in the United States that cross a state line, the other being the Cumberland Gap Tunnel.The tunnel can be seen in the distance from the Big Walker Lookout, a 100-foot observation tower built on a peak near Big Walker Mountain Tunnel.

  <page name="Chaos Crags">Chaos Crags is the youngest group of lava domes in Lassen Volcanic National Park, California, having been formed as five dacite domes 1,100-1,000 years ago. The cluster of domes is located north of Lassen Peak.From the base of the crags and extending toward the northwest corner of the park is Chaos Jumbles, a cold rock avalanche which undermined Chaos Crags' northwest slope 300 years ago. Riding on a cushion of compressed air (see sturzstrom), the rock debris traveled at about , flattened the forest before it, and dammed Manzanita Creek, forming Manzanita Lake.In 1974 the National Park Service took the advice of the USGS and closed the visitor center and accommodations at Manzanita Lake. The USGS stated that these buildings would be in the way of a rockslide from Chaos Crags if an earthquake or volcanic eruption occurred in the area.In 2011, twenty prefab cabins were reinstalled in the Manzanita Lake Campground. It had been determined in the 1980s that the rockslide danger had been overstated by the USGS, and therefore, the cabins were reintroduced to the park for nightly rental.

  <page name="Blackwater Reservoir">The Blackwater Reservoir is a reservoir created behind a dam in the mountains above Kinlochleven, Lochaber, Highland, Scotland. At over 914 m long, the dam is the longest in the Highlands.The hydroelectric scheme was constructed in the early 1900s for the British Aluminium Company (later: British Alcan) for the purpose of smelting aluminium and was designed by engineers Patrick Meik and Charles Meik. Chief assistant resident engineer was William Halcrow.The dam, at 27 m high, was built at an elevation of over 305m in rugged and almost inaccessible terrain, and involved the construction of some 6 km of concrete aqueduct and nearly 13 km of steel pipe in total (four parallel pipelines).The dam was built using hand tools, without the benefit of mechanical earth moving machinery, and has been described as the last major creation of the traditional 'navvy' whose activities in the construction of canals and railways left an indelible mark on the British countryside.The power house and aluminium smelting plant were situated in Kinlochleven, which is adjacent to the sea loch Loch Leven.In recent years the smelting works has closed and has mostly been demolished albeit that a few buildings remain and have been given over to other uses, including a climbing wall which - unusually - has a refrigerated face so that people can practice ice climbing.The power station now produces electricity for the aluminium smelter in Fort William, supplementing the supply from the Lochaber hydroelectric scheme. Any surplus energy is sold to the national grid for public supply. Consequently, the dam, penstocks and other works associated with it remain in use.A number of workers lost their lives constructing the dam; their graves, which are marked by concrete markers, are close to the dam.

It could be derived from old Germanic "wȃg" (stream) or proto-Slavic "vagъ", "vaga" (pole, stick, carved branch) referencing to reinforced riverbanks. Several Slavic river names with a similar motivation exist, but pre-Slavic origin of larger rivers in Slovakia is assumed in general. The earliest mentions are "flumen Vvaga" (1111) and "aqua Vvac"' (1113).A left tributary of the Danube river, the Váh is long, including its Čierny Váh branch. Its two sources, the "Biely Váh" (White Váh) and the "Čierny Váh" (Black Váh), are located in the Vysoké Tatry (High Tatras) and Nízke Tatry (Low Tatra) mountains, respectively, and it flows over northern and western Slovakia and finally feeds into the Danube near Komárno. The left tributaries are Demänovka, Revúca, Ľubochnianka, Turiec, Rajčanka and Nitra rivers, and the right tributaries are Belá, Orava, Varínka, Kysuca, Biela voda, Vlára, Dubová, Dudváh and Malý Dunaj rivers. In late medieval time it was a property of Stibor of Stiboricz and his son Stibor of Beckov of the Clan of Ostoja, later passing to Maurice Benyovszky as a gift of Maria Theresa.It includes canals, artificial dams (Čierny Váh, Liptovská Mara, Bešeňová, Krpeľany, Žilina, Hričov, Nosice, Sĺňava, Madunice, Kráľová and Selice) and 16 hydropower stations, whose construction started in the 1930s and increased after World War II. The main Slovak limited-access motorway is along the Váh (Bratislava – Trenčín – Považská Bystrica – Žilina and Ružomberok – Poprad), as well as the main railway Bratislava – Žilina – Košice.

Major cities and towns on the Hron are Brezno, Banská Bystrica, Sliač, Zvolen, Žiar nad Hronom, Žarnovica, Nová Baňa, Tlmače, Levice, Želiezovce, and Štúrovo.The river's basin covers approximately 11 percent of Slovakia's territory.The name is probably of Germanic origin; "*Granahua": "gran" – spruce, "ahua" – water.The name of the river was mentioned for the first time in 170, when Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius wrote his "Meditations" at the Hron () river. The first recorded medieval name was Gron (1075). From the 17th century until the 1930s, the river was used for wood transport.

It took, however, an important part in the rebellion of 295 BC and was reduced, with Vulsinii and Arretium (Arezzo), to seek for peace in the following year.It seems the city was in the Antonii's clientela since this period, as it was said by historians during imperial times.In 216 BC and 205 BC it assisted Rome in the Hannibalic war, but afterward it is not mentioned until 41-40 BC, when Lucius Antonius took refuge there and was reduced by Octavian after a long siege.Some of the refugees ran away toward Gauls to escape Octavian. A local history said they were the founders of Perouges en Dauphiné Province (France).A number of lead bullets used by slingers have been found in and around the city. The city was burnt, we are told, with the exception of the temples of Vulcan and Juno — the massive Etruscan terrace-walls, naturally, can hardly have suffered at all — and the town, with the territory for a mile round, was allowed to be occupied by whoever chose. It must have been rebuilt almost at once, for several bases exist, inscribed "Augusta sacr(um) Perusia restituta"; but, as we have seen, it did not become a colony until AD 251-253.

  <page name="Sullom Voe">Sullom Voe is an inlet between North Mainland and Northmavine on Shetland in Scotland. It is a location of the Sullom Voe oil terminal and Shetland Gas Plant. The word Voe is from the Old Norse "" and denotes a small bay or narrow creek.The Voe, the longest in Shetland, and partially sheltered by the island of Yell was used as a military airfield during World War II both by the Royal Air Force and the Royal Norwegian Air Force as a location for flying boats. With the coming of the oil terminal, the remains of the airbase were upgraded and modernised to create Scatsta Airport which is primarily used to service the terminal.The first crude oil was discovered in the North Sea in 1969, and soon thereafter construction began on the oil terminal at Sullom Voe, north east of the village of Brae, which became operational in 1975 and was completed in 1982, becoming the largest in Europe. Oil flows via pipeline from the Brent and Ninian oil fields to be loaded onto tankers at Sullom Voe. It has recently begun to serve North Atlantic oil fields as well.When Shetland was identified as a location to provide pipeline terminal and support facilities for off-shore oil installations in the northern North Sea, corporations involved had expected to each build their own terminal facilities. However, wishing to minimise the negative impacts of the industry, the Shetland Islands Council (SIC), with power granted to it by the UK Parliament in the 1974 Zetland County Council Act (ZCC Act), were able to contain all pipeline terminal facilities at the Sullom Voe site, now operated by BP on behalf of a consortium of companies operating in the North Sea and North Atlantic.

  <page name="Tonga Trench">The Tonga Trench is an oceanic trench located in the South Pacific Ocean. It is deep at its deepest point, known as the Horizon Deep. According to the August 2011 version of the GEBCO Gazetteer of Undersea Feature Names, the location and depth of the Horizon Deep are given as and ±.The Tonga Trench is a convergent plate boundary. The trench lies at the northern end of the Kermadec-Tonga Subduction Zone, an active subduction zone where the Pacific Plate is being subducted below the Tonga Plate and the Indo-Australian Plate. The Tonga Trench extends north-northeast from the Kermadec Islands north of the North Island of New Zealand. The trench turns west north of the Tonga Plate and becomes a transform fault zone.The convergence is taking place at a rate estimated at approximately per year (by Lonsdale, 1986); however, recent global positioning satellite measurements indicate in places a convergence of per year across the northern Tonga Trench, which is the fastest plate velocity recorded on the planet; a result is the earth's most active zone of mantle seismicity.While most of the large earthquakes occur at the contact zone between both tectonic plates, related to the friction during subduction, others are produced in the Pacific plate due to its bending.Such oceanic trenches are important sites for the formation of what will become continental crust and for recycling of material back into the mantle. Along the Tonga Trench mantle-derived melts are transferred to the island arc systems, and abyssal oceanic sediments and fragments of oceanic crust are collected.The trench is the last resting place of the radioisotope thermoelectric generator from the aborted Apollo 13 mission.

Mt. Assiniboine rises nearly above Lake Magog. Because of its resemblance to the Matterhorn in the Alps, it is nicknamed the "Matterhorn of the Rockies".Mt. Assiniboine was named by George M. Dawson in 1885. When Dawson saw Mt. Assiniboine from Copper Mountain, he saw a plume of clouds trailing away from the top. This reminded him of the plumes of smoke emanating from the teepees of Assiniboine Indians.Mt. Assiniboine lies on the border between Mount Assiniboine Provincial Park, in British Columbia, and Banff National Park, in Alberta. The park does not have any roads and thus can only be reached by a six-hour hike , three-hour bike ride (now disallowed to reduce human / grizzly encounters) or helicopter. The usual approach is via Bryant Creek. From Canmore follow the Smith-Dorien road to the Mount Shark parking lot. The trail is well signed. A helipad is also here.Mt. Assiniboine was first climbed in 1901 by James Outram, Christian Bohren and Christian Hasler. In 1925, Lawrence Grassi became the first person to make a solo ascent. On August 27, 2001, Bohren's granddaughter Lonnie along with three others made a successful ascent, celebrating the 100th anniversary of the first ascent.There are no scrambling routes up Mt. Assiniboine. The easiest mountaineering routes are the North Ridge and North Face at YDS 5.5 which are reached from the Hind Hut.

  <page name="Pool Malebo">The Pool Malebo – formerly Stanley Pool, also known as Malebo Pool, or Lake Nkunda by local indigenous people in pre-colonial times – is a lake-like widening in the lower reaches of the Congo River. The former name Stanley Pool was named after early European explorer and journalist Henry Morton Stanley.The Pool Malebo is about 35 km (22 mi) long, 23 km (14 mi) wide and 500 km in surface area. Its central part is occupied by M'Bamou or Bamu Island (180 km), which is Republic of the Congo territory. The pool is shallow with depths of 3–10 m, while water levels vary by as much as 3 m over the course of a year at an average altitude of 272 m (900 ft).The capitals of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic of the Congo—Kinshasa and Brazzaville, respectively—are located on opposite shores of Pool Malebo. These are the two closest capital cities in the world (other than Rome, Italy and Vatican City, which are actually contiguous).The Pool is the beginning of the navigable part of the Congo River upstream to the cities of Mbandaka, Kisangani and Bangui. Downstream, the river descends hundreds of meters in a series of rapids known as the Livingstone Falls to reach sea level at the port of Boma after a trajectory of 300 km.There are many palm and papyrus swamps along the edges of the river and pool, and often movement of floating mats of "Eichhornia" plants.Most fish endemic to the area are catfishes, including the mountain catfish, "L. brieni", "Leptoglanis mandevillei", "L. bouilloni" and "Atopochilus chabanaudi", an upside-down catfish. The area has over 200 fish species documented, with Mormyrids as the most common with over 40 species, and with the highest diversification.

  <page name="Villa San Michele">The Villa "San Michele" was built around the turn of the 20th century on the Isle of Capri, Italy, by the Swedish physician and author Axel Munthe.The villa's gardens have panoramic views of the town of Capri and its harbour, the Sorrentine Peninsula, and Mount Vesuvius. The villa sits on a ledge at the top of the Phoenician Steps, between Anacapri and Capri, at a height of 327 meters above sea level.San Michele's gardens are adorned with many relics and works of art dating from ancient Egypt and other periods of classical antiquity. They now form part of the Grandi Giardini Italiani.In his later years, Axel Munthe wrote his haunting youthful memoir "The Story of San Michele" which describes how he first discovered the island and built the villa, decorated with the remains of palaces built by the Ancient Romans which he found on his land. This colourfully written book was first published in 1929 and became an immediate worldwide success, being translated into many languages. It has been reprinted many times since then.Between 1919 and 1920, Munthe was an unwilling landlord to the outrageous socialite and muse Luisa Casati, who took possession of Villa San Michele. This was described by the Scottish author Compton Mackenzie in his diaries.

Its earliest records of history date back to 1298 where in a manuscript of landrights it was mentioned as "Den Leepel Straet."Lepelstraat has always been important in its region's religious history. In 1612 a little church was created in the attic of a farmhouse that was kept from the knowledge of authorities because Roman Catholicism was forbidden at that time. Even though this situation changed later in the 17th century, it existed until 1875 when Lepelstraat got its first real church, with a tower having a height of 68 metres. This tower was blown up near the end of World War II by retreating German troops and has never been rebuilt.During the Netherlands' "Great Flood" in 1953 most of the land around Lepelstraat became flooded, costing almost two thousand lives. The water did not reach Lepelstraat itself, making it a safe haven for the unlucky people who lost their homes, friends, and families.

  <page name="Campbeltown Airport">Campbeltown Airport () is located at Machrihanish, west of Campbeltown, near the tip of the Kintyre peninsula in Argyll and Bute on the west coast of Scotland.The airport was formerly known as RAF Machrihanish (after the village of Machrihanish) and hosted squadrons of the Royal Air Force and other NATO air forces as well as the United States Marine Corps. The airport is at a strategic point near the Irish Sea, and was used to guard the entrance to the Firth of Clyde where US nuclear submarines were based at Holy Loch and where Royal Navy Trident missile submarines are still based at HMNB Clyde (Faslane Naval Base).The United States Navy handed the airfield back to the MoD on 30 June 1995, marking the end of its service as a NATO facility since 1960. The airbase was sold to Machrihanish Airbase Community Company (MACC) in May 2012, and two thirds of the runway is leased to Highlands and Islands Airports for Campbeltown Airport.At , the original runway 11/29 at Campbeltown Airport is the longest of any public airport in Scotland. It was built between 1960 and 1962 as part of a major reconstruction for the airport's role in NATO.Campbeltown Aerodrome has a CAA Ordinary Licence (Number P808) that allows flights for the public transport of passengers or for flying instruction as authorised by the licensee (Highlands &amp; Islands Airports Limited)

  <page name="Gasherbrum I">Gasherbrum I (; ), also known as Hidden Peak or K5, is the 11th highest mountain in the world at above sea level. It is located on the Pakistani–Chinese border in Gilgit–Baltistan region of Pakistan and Xinjiang region of China. Gasherbrum I is part of the Gasherbrum massif, located in the Karakoram region of the Himalaya. Gasherbrum is often claimed to mean "Shining Wall", presumably a reference to the highly visible face of the neighboring peak Gasherbrum IV; but in fact it comes from "rgasha" (beautiful) + "brum" (mountain) in Balti, hence it actually means "beautiful mountain."Gasherbrum I was designated K5 (meaning the 5th peak of the Karakoram) by T.G. Montgomerie in 1856 when he first spotted the peaks of the Karakoram from more than 200 km away during the Great Trigonometric Survey of India. In 1892, William Martin Conway provided the alternate name, Hidden Peak, in reference to its extreme remoteness.Gasherbrum I was first climbed on July 5, 1958 by Pete Schoening and Andy Kauffman of an eight-man American expedition led by Nicholas B. Clinch. Richard K. Irvin, Tom Nevison, Tom McCormack, Bob Swift and Gil Roberts were also members of the team.

  <page name="Mount Chephren">Mount Chephren is a mountain located in the Mistaya River Valley of Banff National Park, Canada.Mount Chephren was named after Chephren, the 4th Dynasty Egyptian pharaoh. The mountain was originally named Pyramid Mountain in 1897 by J. Norman Collie, but it conflicted with an identically named peak in Jasper National Park, so it was renamed in 1918 to its present name.Mount Chephren is rated a difficult scramble on the south face due to its steep upper slopes with possible snow and ice difficulties. Considerable snow on the route would likely require crampons and an ice axe, thereby pushing the climb into the realm of technical mountaineering. The best conditions for scrambling would normally be late July and August.The trail head is located at the west end of the Waterfowl Lakes campground off the Icefields Parkway in Banff National Park. The elevation gain from the trail head to the summit is .There are three main routes:

  <page name="Enguera">Enguera () is a municipality in southwestern province of Valencia, Spain.The local economy depends primarily on agriculture, and secondarily on industry and services. In recent years, agricultural crops, especially olives, have gained in importance, although the complementary or secondary component of agriculture is evident. Rural tourism, including camping, country homes, a hotel, and restaurants are gaining importance. Meanwhile, the once-flourishing industry that was an important part of the village economy at the end of the eighteenth century has faded almost to nothing. While many of Enguera's inhabitants work in industry, their jobs are in nearby towns.The Sierra de Enguera is named after this town.

  <page name="Wielka Piaśnica">Wielka Piaśnica (; ) is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Puck, within Puck County, Pomeranian Voivodeship, in northern Poland. It lies approximately west of Puck and north-west of the regional capital Gdańsk.After the 1939 Invasion of Poland, German SS from Danzig (Gdańsk) and local German "Selbstschutz" members executed about 12,000 civilians,&lt;ref name="Cherry/Orla-Bukowska"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; mainly Polish and Kashubian intelligentsia from the Pomeranian Voivodeship, in the Darżlubska forest next to the village. Among the victims were approximately 1,200 mentally ill persons from local hospitals, killed in the course of the forced euthanasia policy dubbed Action T4.The mass executions began in October 1939 and lasted until April 1940. An exhumation of mass graves was carried after World War II in 1946. Out of total number of 35 graves, 30 were localised of which 26 were exhumed. Only 305 bodies (in two mass graves) were found, the rest of the bodies was burnt by Germans in August–September 1944. Sonderkommandos (forced prison labourers) from Stutthof concentration camp were used to cover up the tracks and were later executed.

  <page name="Portree">Portree (, ) is the largest town on Skye in the Inner Hebrides of Scotland. It is the location for the only secondary school on the island, Portree High School. Public transport services are limited to buses.Portree has a harbour, fringed by cliffs, with a pier designed by Thomas Telford.Attractions in the town include the Aros centre which celebrates the island's Gaelic heritage. Further arts provision is made through arts organisation ATLAS Arts, a Creative Scotland regularly-funded organisation. The town also serves as a centre for tourists exploring the island.The Royal Hotel is the site of MacNab's Inn, the last meeting place of Flora MacDonald and Bonnie Prince Charlie in 1746.The town plays host to the Isle of Skye's shinty club, Skye Camanachd. They play at Pairc nan Laoch above the town on the road to Struan.Around 939 people (37.72% of the population) can speak Scottish Gaelic.The A855 road leads north out of the town, passing through villages such as Achachork, Staffin and passes the rocky landscape of the Storr before reaching the landslip of the Quiraing.The current name, "Port Rìgh" translates as 'king's port', possibly from a visit by King James V of Scotland in 1540. However this etymology has been contested, since James did not arrive in peaceful times. The older name appears to have been "Port Ruighe(adh)", meaning "slope harbour".Prior to the 16th century the settlement's name was Kiltaraglen ('the church of St. Talarican') from Gaelic "Cill Targhlain".Portree shale is a geologic association in the vicinity of Portree, the existence of which is linked with potential petroleum occurrences of commercial importance.

  <page name="Mount Alberta">Mount Alberta is a mountain located in the upper Athabasca River Valley of Jasper National Park, Canada. J. Norman Collie named the mountain in 1898 after Princess Louise Caroline Alberta.Mount Alberta is the sixth highest peak of the Canadian Rockies. It is situated southeast of the town of Jasper.The base was reached via Fortress Lake in 1901 by the German explorer Jean Habel. Photographs of the peak generated significant interest among mountaineers.The first ascent in 1925 was made by members of the Japanese Alpine Club: S. Hashimoto, H. Hatano, T. Hayakawa, Y. Maki, Y.Mita, N. Okabe. The team was guided by Hans Fuhrer, H. Kohler and J. Weber, and the leader of the team was Maki. This team consisted of four Keio University alpine club members and two Gakushuin University alpine club members. They started climbing on July 21st, 1925. After some difficulty in dealing with an overhang and a steep series of ledges for 16 hours, they reached the top and ceremoniously planted an ice axe. The ice axe was left as a symbol of their achievement. The second party that achieved the ascent found this ice axe 23 years later, and brought it back to the American Alpine Club in New York. The handle of the ice axe had been broken by the ice and rocks. In 1969, the handle was found by a Japanese party, and the two parts were put together in Tokyo in 1997. This ice axe is now exhibited in Jasper Yellowhead Museum.The second ascent was completed in 1948 by Americans Fred Ayers and John Oberlin. In 1958, the first ascent by a Canadian team was completed by Neil Brown, Hans Gmoser, Leo Grillmair, Heinz Kahl and Sarka Spinkova.There are a number of standard climbing routes:

  <page name="Cherwell District">Cherwell (usually , but in Oxford) is a local government district in northern Oxfordshire, England. The district takes its name from the River Cherwell, which drains south through the region to flow into the River Thames at Oxford.Towns in Cherwell include Banbury and Bicester. Kidlington is a contender for largest village in England.The district was formed on 1 April 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, by a merger of the municipal borough of Banbury, Bicester urban district, Banbury Rural District and Ploughley Rural District.The Northern half of the Cherwell district consists mainly of soft rolling hills vallying down towards to River Cherwell, however the southern half of the district around Bicester is much flatter.Much of the district is soft rolling hills with the northwest of the district lying at the northern extremity of the Cotswolds.Much of the district is within easy reach of the M40, with junctions 9, 10 and 11 in the district. It also has good rail links with London, Birmingham, Oxford and the South.Cherwell district has one of the country's highest recycling rates at over 40% (2005). The district used to have a recycling rate of just 9%. This changed with the introduction of the blue box scheme for recycling paper, which has since grown to include plastic, cardboard and cans. Kidlington has its own freecycling group.Cherwell District came top of a "Which?" study that ranked 395 local authorities in Britain on their record of enforcement of food safety regulations.

  <page name="Cannon Street Railway Bridge">Cannon Street Railway Bridge is a bridge in central London, crossing the River Thames. Downstream, the next bridge is London Bridge, and upstream Southwark Bridge. It carries trains over the river to Cannon Street station on the north bank. It was originally named "Alexandra Bridge" after Alexandra of Denmark who was the wife of the future King Edward VII.The bridge was designed by John Hawkshaw and John Wolfe-Barry for the South Eastern Railway. It was opened in 1866 after three years of construction. In its original form, it carried the railway over the Thames on five spans standing on cast-iron Doric pillars. It was subsequently widened between 1886–93 by Francis Brady and extensively renovated by British Rail between 1979–82, which resulted in many of its ornamental features being removed and the structure taking on an even more utilitarian appearance than before.It was the scene of the Marchioness disaster in 1989.

  <page name="Mount Athabasca">Mount Athabasca is located in the Columbia Icefield of Jasper National Park in Canada. The mountain was named in 1898 by J. Norman Collie, who made the first ascent on August 18 of that year. Athabasca is the Cree Indian name for "where there are reeds" which originally referred to Lake Athabasca.There are several climbing routes, including:One of the most prominent features of Mount Athabasca is a horned-shaped tip near the top called the "Silverhorn". The Silverhorn is one of the easier routes to the summit but requires more caution and ability than the normal route because of blue ice and falling ice from other parties. Although not apparent from the typical roadside view of the mountain, the south side of Silverhorn contains a scrambling route but one must still cross the north glacier to get to it. From the top of the Silverhorn, the summit is a rather easy 15-minute plod in good summer weather over the narrow snow-covered summit ridge.

The island is long and wide, with a total area of .According to legend, a giant named Vist created Visingsö by throwing a lump of soil into the lake so that his wife could use it to step over the lake.In the 12th and 13th century, Näs Castle on the southern end of Visingsö was the residence for the fragile Swedish monarchy. Four Swedish kings died there: Karl Sverkersson, Erik Knutsson, Johan Sverkersson, and Magnus Ladulås.Furthermore, in the 17th century the influential Brahe family resided in Visingsborg, a castle on the eastern side of the island. Both Näs Castle and Visingsborg are presently ruins and well known landmarks of Visingsö.The Swedish Navy planted oak trees on the island in the 19th century to provide strategically important timber for future ship construction. The timber is now ready but no longer required for ship construction. Consequently, Visingsö is partially covered by oak forests, the rest being farmland.Visingsö has long been of interest to geologists because of the development of a sedimentary series of rocks (the Visingsö Group) there (and elsewhere around Lake Vättern, especially on the west side). The surrounding rocks are largely much older "Småland granites" of mixed granite-like compositions. The Visingsö Group is approximately 1000 m thick and is divided into three units. It is Late Riphean in date. A wide array of late Precambrian fossils have been recovered from the group, including stromatolites, vase-shaped microfossils, acritarchs and macro fossils such as "Chuaria". The sediments of the Visingsö Group have been preserved within the Lake Vättern graben structure.Panorama over Visingsö from Brahehus

  <page name="Pumori">Pumori () (or Pumo Ri) is a mountain on the Nepal-Tibet border in the Mahalangur section of the Himalayas. Pumori lies just eight kilometres west of Mount Everest. Pumori, meaning "the Mountain Daughter" in Sherpa language, was named by George Mallory. "Pumo" means young girl or daughter and "Ri" means mountain in Sherpa language. Climbers sometimes refer to Pumori as "Everest's Daughter". Mallory also called it Clare Peak, after his own daughter.Pumori is a popular climbing peak and the easiest route is graded class 3, although with significant avalanche danger. Pumori was first climbed on May 17, 1962 by Gerhard Lenser on a German-Swiss expedition. Two Czechs (Leopold Sulovský and Zdeněk Michalec) climbed a new route on the south face in the spring of 1996.An outlier of Pumori is Kala Patthar (5,643m/18,513'), which appears as a big brown bump below the impressive south face of Pumori. Many trekkers going to see Mount Everest up close will attempt to climb to the top of Kala Patthar.Nearly 500 people had summitted Pumori by 2005, at a cost of 42 lives. It was noted for its increasing popularity by 2008, with such features as being able to use the Everest base camp for Nepal (when its occupied that is) when trekking or climbing Pumori and offering solid views of Tibet, Nepal and Everest. However, there has been some dangers from avalanches including some Spanish climbing teams that took heavy losses (such as in 1989 and 2001), and the 2015 avalanche, though it was likely triggered by the 2015 Earthquake, is said to have originated from the Pumori-Lingtren ridge.

It lies two kilometres WSW of Mount Everest. Nubtse is Tibetan for "west peak", as it is the western segment of the Lhotse-Nubtse massif.The long east-west trending main ridge of Nubtse is crowned by seven peaks:The main peak, Nubtse I, was first climbed on May 16, 1961 by Dennis Davis and Sherpa Tashi and the following day by Chris Bonington, Les Brown, James Swallow and Pemba Sherpa, members of a British expedition led by Joe Walmsley. After a long hiatus, Nubtse again became the objective of high-standard mountaineers in the 1990s and 2000s, with important routes being put up on its west, south, and north faces.While Nubtse is a dramatic peak when viewed from the south or west, and it towers above the base camp for the standard south col route on Everest, it is not a particularly independent peak: its topographic prominence is only . Hence it is not ranked on the list of highest mountains.

  <page name="Emi Koussi">Emi Koussi is a high pyroclastic shield volcano that lies at the southeast end of the Tibesti Mountains in the central Sahara of northern Chad. It is the highest mountain in Chad, and the highest in the Sahara. The volcano is one of several in the Tibesti massif, and reaches in elevation, rising above the surrounding sandstone plains. The volcano is 60 by 80 km wide.Two nested calderas cap the volcano, the outer one being about 12 by 15 km in size. Within it on the southeast side is a smaller caldera, about 2–3 km wide and 350 m deep. Numerous lava domes, cinder cones, maars, and lava flows are found both within the calderas and along the outer flanks of the shield. The inner caldera contains large natron deposits which see some harvesting for domestic animal salt lick use by the local people.Emi Koussi has been studied as an analogue of the Martian volcano Elysium Mons. One of the most important morphological differences between volcanoes on Mars and Earth is the widespread furrowing of the surface due to flowing water on terrestrial volcanoes. The furrows are shallow valleys. Larger channels have a different origin. Major channels can be seen on volcanoes on both planets and indicate low points in caldera rims where lava spilled out of pre-collapse craters.It was climbed in September 1938 by Wilfred Thesiger and Idris Daud as recorded in the former's autobiography "A Life of My Choice."

  <page name="Haramosh Peak">Haramosh Peak (also known as Haramosh or Peak 58) is a mountain located in the Karakoram range of the Gilgit-Baltistan of Pakistan. Its height is also often given as 7,409m.Haramosh lies about east of Gilgit, in the south-central region of the Rakaposhi-Haramosh Mountains, a subrange of the Karakoram range. It rises steeply above the north bank of the Indus River, a little ways upstream of its confluence with the Gilgit River. The massif has two summits, Haramosh Peak and Haramosh Kutwal Laila Peak. The peak was first scaled in 1958 by an Austrian team consisting of Heini Roiss, Stephan Pauer, and Dr. Franz Mandl.Haramosh was first reconnoitered in 1947 by a Swiss team, and a German team investigated a northeastern route in 1955. In 1957, Tony Streather, John Emery, Bernard Jillot and Rae Culbert, a team from Oxford University experienced repeated falls and misfortunes during a failed attempt, leading to the deaths of Jillot and Culbert. Streather and Emery survived. The latter suffered severe frostbite and lost all of his fingers and toes.The epic tale of this expedition is told in Ralph Barker's "The Last Blue Mountain".Haramosh was first climbed on 4 August 1958 by the Austrians Heinrich Roiss, Stefan Pauer and Franz Mandl, via the Haramosh La (a saddle to the northeast) and the East Ridge, roughly the route of the 1957 tragedy.According to the Himalayan Index, there have been only three more ascents, in 1978 (Japanese, West Ridge), 1979 (unknown party/route), and 1988 (Polish, Southwest Face).

  <page name="M69 motorway">The M69 is a dual three lane dual carriageway motorway in Leicestershire and Warwickshire, England. It runs between junction 21 of the M1 near Leicester and junction 2 of the M6 near Coventry. It opened in 1977.The motorway, also known at the time as the 'Coventry – Leicester Motorway' was completed in 1977 following a public inquiry in 1972. It took traffic from the A46, which was subsequently downgraded.Starting at the northeastern suburbs of Coventry at junction 2 of the M6, the motorway crosses the Coventry Canal and then continues northeast past Bulkington and west of Wolvey before turning more easterly to run south of Hinckley. It then crosses the Birmingham to Peterborough railway line before ending on the southwestern edge of Leicester.The motorway has no services.There is an aspiration to construct a new slip road and road bridge for traffic travelling southbound on the M1 south to join the M69.Since the completion of the M69 motorway linking Coventry and Leicester, the motorway's number has given its name to the derby between the two football clubs playing in each city – Coventry City and Leicester City. These two clubs are rivals in the M69 derby.

  <page name="Whitefish Bay">Whitefish Bay is a large bay on the eastern end of the southern shore of Lake Superior between Michigan and Ontario. It is located between Whitefish Point in Michigan, about 10 miles north of Paradise, and the St. Marys River at Sault Ste. Marie on the southeast. On the Ontario side, the bay is bordered by the more rugged, largely wilderness Canadian Shield. The international boundary runs through the bay, which is heavily used by shipping traffic northbound from and southbound to the Soo Locks. The Whitefish Point Light marks the entry of the bay, Ile Parisienne Light is in the middle of the bay, and Point Iroquois Light lies near the mouth of the bay and the approach to the Soo Locks.After the Soo Locks opened in 1855 and ship traffic increased on Lake Superior, Whitefish Bay was the site of numerous shipwrecks, often due to hazardous weather. The Whitefish Point Underwater Preserve was established to preserve many of the shipwrecks of Whitefish Bay for future generations of sports divers. Known wrecks include the ships , , "Drake", , , , "Niagara", , , , and .Whitefish Point is the home of a former United States Coast Guard station; Whitefish Point Lighthouse is the oldest active light on Lake Superior. Part of the lighthouse station houses the Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum. It holds artifacts from the above shipwrecks and has information on the notable wreck of in 1975, in which all 29 crew were lost.The Point is a popular place for rock collectors, ship watchers, and spectacular bird watching. Whitefish Point's land and water provides a natural corridor for birds that makes it a migratory route of world significance. It is a designated Important Bird Area where the Whitefish Point Bird Observatory conducts important research.

  <page name="Soo Locks">The Soo Locks (sometimes spelled Sault Locks, but pronounced "soo") are a set of parallel locks which enable ships to travel between Lake Superior and the lower Great Lakes. They are located on the St. Marys River between Lake Superior and Lake Huron, between the Upper Peninsula of the US state of Michigan and the Canadian province of Ontario. They bypass the rapids of the river, where the water falls 21 feet (7 m).The locks pass an average of 10,000 ships per year, despite being closed during the winter from January through March, when ice shuts down shipping on the Great Lakes. The winter closure period is used to inspect and maintain the locks.The locks share a name (usually shortened and anglicized as "Soo") with the two cities named Sault Ste. Marie, in Ontario and in Michigan, located on either side of the St. Marys River. The Sault Ste. Marie International Bridge between the United States and Canada permits vehicular traffic to pass over the locks. A railroad bridge crosses the St. Marys River just upstream of the highway bridge.The U.S. locks form part of a canal formally named the St. Marys Falls Canal. The entire canal, including the locks, is owned and maintained by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, which provides free passage. The first iteration of the U.S. Soo Locks was completed in May 1855; it was operated by the State of Michigan until transferred to the U.S. Army in 1881.The current configuration consists of four parallel lock chambers, each running east to west; starting at the Michigan shoreline and moving north toward Ontario, these are:

  <page name="Långnäs">Långnäs is a port in Lumparland on the eastern mainland of Åland, about 30 km over the road away from Åland's capital Mariehamn. Road ferries to Kumlinge (Snäckö) and Galtby via Föglö (Överö) and Kökar start here.In the early 1960s, Silja Line built a ferry terminal in Långnäs, designed by architect Bengt Lundsten. The terminal was in use 1965-1975 and was then closed and removed in 1993. A new terminal was built in 1999 to accommodate the large cruiseferries on the Stockholm—Turku route. It is used as an alternative to Mariehamn harbour on connections with little passenger traffic to and from Åland.In 1999, European Union legislation outlawed the sale of duty-free goods on ferry cruises within the EU, but Åland's tax privileges provide a legal exemption for ships that call at a port in Åland. As duty-free sales are a considerable source of revenue for the ferry shipping companies, the major routes between the Stockholm region (Kapellskär and Stockholm) and southern Finland (Turku and Helsinki) include a stop there.

  <page name="Harlesden station">Harlesden is a Network Rail station on Acton Lane in northwest London, served by London Overground and by London Underground Bakerloo line trains. The railway line here is the border between the Harlesden and Stonebridge residential area in the east, and the Park Royal industrial estate to the west. The southern end of Willesden Brent Sidings separates the station from the West Coast Main Line.It should not be confused with Harlesden (Midland) railway station, which closed to passengers in 1902 and was nearby on the Dudding Hill Line.The first station at the site was which was opened in 1841 by the London and Birmingham Railway and closed in 1866, replaced by Willesden Junction station, to the south east. In the Watford DC Line program of new electrified suburban tracks of the London and North Western Railway, a new station, "Harlesden", opened on 15 June 1912. Bakerloo line services on the same tracks began on 16 April 1917, via a new junction at Queens Park station. The Watford Junction to modernisation project was completed in 1922.London bus routes 187, 206, 224, 226, 228, 260 and 487.

  <page name="South Kenton station">South Kenton is a Network Rail station served by London Underground Bakerloo line and London Overground trains. It is between Kenton to the north, and North Wembley to the south. It is located between The Link in the Sudbury Court Estate and Windermere Grove in South Kenton, in the Wembley postal area.The station opened on 3 July 1933 with access from both sides of the railway via a footbridge to the single island platform serving only the Euston-Watford DC line; this footbridge (which started at the bottom of the embankment) was later replaced by a pedestrian tunnel, cutting out a long climb for passengers entering the station. The station was built in a more modern "concrete and glass" style construction including a "streamlined" waiting room rather than the brick and woodwork LNWR stations elsewhere on the DC line.The station is an island platform and Bakerloo line train doors are not level with it. Therefore, there is a downward step to the train from the platform. The ticket office is at platform level and occupies the north end of the streamlined 1933 building. It is one of the very few stations served by London Underground which has no ticket gates and due to the restrictive layout here there are no plans for these to be installed in the immediate future. There is no wheelchair access.There are regular London Underground trains on the Bakerloo line heading southbound towards Central London and Elephant &amp; Castle and northbound to Harrow &amp; Wealdstone.Monday to Saturday daytimes there is the London Overground service every 20 minutes to London Euston southbound and to Watford Junction northbound. The service is every 30 mins evenings and Sundays.London Buses route 223 serve the station.

  <page name="Browne Falls">Browne Falls is a waterfall above Doubtful Sound, which is located in Fiordland National Park, New Zealand. In a temperate rain forest, the falls cascade down to the fiord near Hall Arm. Heights of 619 metres and 836 metres have been given for the falls.Their source is a tarn called Lake Browne (836 m above sea level) which when full, overflows down the side of the mountain face (similar to Sutherland's source). The stream makes 836 m height difference over 1,130 m horizontal difference, thus the mean gradient of stream is 42 degrees. This comparatively low angle makes the falls less impressive.The falls are one of the two candidates for the title of New Zealand's highest waterfall. The other is sourced from a tarn behind Elizabeth Island which is also in Fiordland.The falls are named after pioneering aerial photographer, Victor Carlyle Browne, who discovered Lake Browne and the associated falls on one of his flights over Fiordland in the 1940s.There are at least two other notable waterfalls falling to Doubtful Sound: Helena Falls and Lady Alice Falls.There is a diversity of plant and birdlife in the vicinity and watershed of Browne Falls. Extensive stands of nothofagus dominated trees are present along with a wide variety of understory ferns and shrubs; examples of the forest floor vegetation include Crown Fern, "Blechnum discolor".

  <page name="Schokland">Schokland () is a former island in the Dutch Zuiderzee, in the municipality of Noordoostpolder. Schokland was an elongated strip of peat land which ceased to be an island when the Noordoostpolder was reclaimed from the sea in 1942. It is now just a slightly elevated part of the polder, with a still partly intact retaining wall of the waterfront of Middelbuurt. On 1 April 2014, it had 8 inhabitants, but according to Statistics Netherlands there are five people living on the former island.Schokland was an attractive settlement area in the Middle Ages, but by the 19th century it was under continuous threat of flooding due to the rise in sea level. By then the Schoklanders had retreated to the three most elevated parts: Emmeloord, Molenbuurt, and Middelbuurt. A major flood in 1825 brought massive destruction, and in 1859 the government decided to end permanent settlement on Schokland. The former municipality of Schokland was joined to Kampen on the mainland.Today Schokland is a popular archeological site and host to the Schokland Museum. Schokland was the first UNESCO World Heritage Site in the Netherlands.The nearest railway stations are in Kampen and Lelystad.Bus service 682 operates from Kampen and serves Schokland.

  <page name="Attica Correctional Facility">The Attica Correctional Facility is a maximum security/supermax New York State prison in the town of Attica, New York, operated by the New York State Department of Correctional Services. After it was constructed in the 1930s, it held many of the most dangerous criminals of the time. A tear gas system installed in the mess hall and industry areas has been used to quell conflicts in these areas. The prison now holds many inmates who are serving various types of sentences (short-term to life), and who are usually sent to the facility because of disciplinary problems in other facilities.Attica was the site of a prison riot in 1971 which resulted in 43 deaths, of which 33 were convicts and ten were correctional officers and civilian employees. One officer died at the hands of the rioting convicts in the riot's early stages. The rest died by gunfire from state troopers and other retired officers. One of the biggest reasons for the riot was overcrowding, but to this day Attica Correctional Facility is still over maximum capacity by double bunking a small portion of their population in small cells designed to house only one inmate.

  <page name="Strelasund">The Strelasund or Strela Sound is a sound or lagoon of the Baltic Sea which separates Rügen from the German mainland. It is crossed by a road and rail bridge called the Rügendamm in Stralsund. It runs northwest to southeast from a small shallow bay just north of Stralsund called the Kubitzer Bodden through to another such bay, the Greifswalder Bodden in the southeast. The sound is nowhere much more than 3 km wide, reaching its greatest width towards its southeast end. It is roughly 25 km long.The only island of any size in the Strelasund is Dänholm just off Stralsund, which carries part of the Rügendamm across the sound.On the Rügen side, the shore is in many places steep, although this is punctuated by lower shorelines with reed beds in some places. On the mainland side, however, the shores are overridingly flat.The Strelasund has been the site of two battles. The first in 1362 and the second in 1369 both pitted Danish king Valdemar IV against the Hanseatic fleet. Differences between the two parties were settled by the Treaty of Stralsund in 1370.

  <page name="La Catedral">La Catedral was a prison overlooking the city of Medellín, in Colombia. The prison was built to specifications ordered by Medellín Cartel leader Pablo Escobar, under a 1991 agreement with the Colombian government in which Escobar would surrender to authorities and serve a maximum term of five years, and the Colombian government would not extradite him to the United States. In addition to the facility being built to Escobar's specifications, Escobar was also given the right to choose who would guard him, and it was believed he chose guards loyal only to him. Moreover, the prison was believed to have been designed more to keep out Escobar's enemies and protect him from assassination attempts, than to keep Escobar in.The finished prison was often called "Hotel Escobar" or "Club Medellín", because of its amenities. La Catedral featured a football pitch, giant doll house, bar, jacuzzi, and waterfall. Escobar also had a telescope installed that allowed him to look down onto the city of Medellín to his daughter's residence while talking on the phone with her.PBS reports that although the government was willing to turn a blind eye to Escobar's continuing his drug smuggling, the arrangement fell apart when it was reported Escobar had four of his lieutenants tortured and murdered within La Catedral. The Colombian government decided it had to move Escobar to a standard prison, an order Escobar refused. In July 1992, after serving one year and one month, Escobar again went on the run. With the Colombian National Army surrounding La Catedral's facility, it is said Escobar simply walked out the back gate. The ensuing manhunt employed a 600-man unit force, specially trained by the United States Delta Force, named Search Bloc and led by Colonel Hugo Martinez.

  <page name="Jiri">Jiri (जिरी) is a municipality in Dolakha District in the Janakpur Zone of north-eastern Nepal. At the time of the 1991 Nepal census it had a population of 7,138 people living in 1,508 individual households.Jiri lies at an altitude of 1,905 metres (6,250 feet) and is the eastern-most terminus of the highway coming from Kathmandu. Bus service is available from Kathmandu but the 184 km ride takes 6 to 8 hours due to narrow, winding roads and checkpoints along the high-way(until 2006). A company of the Nepal Army is stationed in town and visitors' equipment and backpacks might be searched. There are a number of lodges available along either side of the main road mainly in Jiri Bazaar.There are two high schools namely Jiri Higher Secondary School at Hatdanda and Dhungeshwori Secondary School at Jiri Bazaar.Jiri was set up as agricultural development centre by the Swiss Government Aid in 1938.As the closest roadhead, Jiri is the trailhead for many treks into the Mount Everest region. The trek to Lukla takes seven or eight days. Few people begin a trek from Jiri, and only 5% of all trekkers who attempt the difficult trek to Everest Base Camp start at Jiri. The other 95% choose to fly into the small airstrip at Lukla, thus cutting off a week of difficult but beautiful trekking.Although the trailhead from Jiri into Sagarmatha National Park is referred to as the "classic route to Everest", the original trailhead began at Kathmandu. All early Everest expeditions—including the one led by John Hunt that put Tenzing Norgay and Edmund Hillary on the summit—passed through Jiri. So Jiri is also called the "Gateway to Mt. Everest".Jiri is the home of an ethnic group called the Jirels and Sherpa.

Gage Roads was the location of the 1987 America's Cup,Rottnest Island lies to the west of Gage Roads, Owen Anchorage and Cockburn Sound lie to the south.The area is the most northern of one of four coastal basins formed from the flooding of a depression between Pleistocene aeolianite ridges running north-south, and the subsequent deposition of east-west Holocene banks. The seabed of Gage Roads is covered by seagrass.Gage Roads was named after Rear-Admiral Sir William Hall Gage who was Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Navy's East Indies Station when James Stirling was surveying the Swan River in 1826.Gage Roads is identified in shipping reports listing ships at anchor prior to entering the port of Fremantle.At certain times, over 10 ships can be seen anchored in Gage Roads waiting to enter the port of Fremantle. In addition to these waiting ships, oversized ships that are unable to enter the inner harbour due to size or draft are required to anchor in Gage Roads.In the early 1900s, the local boat SS "Zephyr" regularly took cruises in Gage Roads. In the 2000s, the has used Gage Roads for short sailing cruises.During the World War II era, the Leighton Guns (also known as Leighton Battery) on Buckland Hill were part of the main anti-aircraft defence of the Gage Roads area.The guns were still operable into the Gage Roads area in the 1950s.Swimmers in the Rottnest Channel Swim (an annual swimming event) start at Cottesloe beach, cross Gage Roads and finish at Rottnest Island.

  <page name="Gotska Sandön">Gotska Sandön (literally translated as Gotlandic Sand Island) is an uninhabited Swedish island, since 1909 also a national park, situated north of Fårö in the Baltic Sea. Legally a part of Gotland province, it is approximately long and wide, with a total area of approximately . The island consists mostly of sand and is dominated by beaches, dunes and especially pine forests. Aside from a colony of grey seals, the higher fauna is not very rich. However, the island is home to many rare insects and plants, including the Kashubian vetch and several species of orchid. During the summer, there are regular boat tours from Fårö Island and Nynäshamn on the mainland.Despite its isolation from sizeable landmasses, Gotska Sandön's oceanic climate is warm for its latitude. The Scandinavian Peninsula to the west contributes to warmer summers and frequent winter frost, giving the island a far broader temperature range than, for example, the similarly isolated Fair Isle, which lies one degree further north some distance off the coast of Scotland. In spite of this range, summer highs are cool by the standards of southern Sweden, and winter nights are among the mildest in the country.Gotska Sandön has significant seasonal lag: despite dwindling daylight hours, August is much warmer than June, while March days are both longer and colder than those in December.

Its western shore is formed by Awaji Island, and its northern and eastern shores are part of the Kansai metropolitan area.Major ports on Osaka Bay include Osaka, Kobe, Nishinomiya, Sakai, Amagasaki, and Hannan.A number of artificial islands have been created in Osaka Bay in past decades, including Kansai International Airport, Port Island, and Rokko Island.Several islands at the south end of Osaka Bay are part of the Seto Inland Sea National Park.Industries locate around Osaka Bay because there is a skilled and plentiful workforce, many port facilities, efficient linkages (from small to medium to large firms). There are good transport links (including the Shinkansen), room for expansion (land reclaimed from the sea), and a large local market (9 million).There has been a recent economic change in Osaka Bay: The decline of older 'heavy' industries such as Nippon Steel, and the expansion of 'new tech' companies such as ICT. There has been a growth in the quaternary industries — research, development, and information. There has also been a development in the science parks and the building of new motorways; this has meant the loss of the countryside.The Tempozan Ferris Wheel and Osaka Aquarium Kaiyukan are both located in the Tempozan Harbor Village area of Osaka.

  <page name="Hoverla">Mount Hoverla (, "Hoverla"; ; ; "Goverla", ) at , is the highest mountain in Ukraine and part of the Carpathian Mountains. The mountain is located in the Eastern Beskides, in the Chornohora region. The slopes are covered with beech and spruce forests, above which there is a belt of sub-alpine meadows called "polonyna" in Ukrainian. At the eastern slope there is the main spring of the Prut River. The name is of Old Hungarian origin and means 'snow mountain'. Hoverla is composed of sandstone, a sedimentary rock type.The date of the first ascent is unknown. In late 19th century the mountain became a notable tourist attraction, especially among tourists from nearby cities of Galicia. In 1880 the first tourist route between the peak of Hoverla and Krasny Luh was marked by Leopold Wajgel of the Galician Tatra Society. The following year the first tourist shelter was founded there.In the 20th century the mountain increasingly gained popularity as an extreme sports site. Some routes are classified as 1A in the winter period (from late autumn to May), according to the USSR grading system. Nowadays because of its prominence too many unskilled extreme-lovers are taking attempts to climb it in winter, resulting in regular frostbite or even deaths. The most popular approach to the summit starts from the "tour-basa" Zaroslach on the mountain's east face and gains more than 3,600 vertical feet (1,100 meters) along a steep path with few switchbacks.In October 2007 the new Right pro-Russian Eurasia Party-affiliated “Eurasian Youth Union” vandalized the official Ukrainian state symbols that had been placed on the summit of Mount Hoverla.

  <page name="Gravensteen">The Gravensteen is a castle in Ghent originating from the Middle Ages. The name means "castle of the counts" in Dutch. The Gravensteen is situated at an altitude of 9 meters.The present castle was built in 1180 by count Philip of Alsace and was modeled after the crusaders castles that Philip of Alsace encountered while he participated in the second crusade. Before its construction, there stood a wooden castle on the same location, presumably built in the ninth century. The castle served as the seat of the Counts of Flanders until they abandoned it in the 14th century. The castle was then used as a courthouse, a prison and eventually decayed. Houses were built against the walls and even on the courtyard and the stones of the walls were used to erect other buildings. At one time it even served as a factory. At the end of the 19th century, the castle was scheduled to be demolished.In 1885 the city of Ghent bought the castle and started a renovation project. The newly built houses were removed and the walls and keep were restored to their original condition.The castle has been repaired enough to allow people to travel through it and climb on top. It is still partly surrounded by the moat. Inside is a museum with various torture devices (and a guillotine) that were historically used in Ghent."The White Queen", a BBC drama series set in the 15th century, used the inside of the castle squares for some scenes and the outside view of the castle with the moat was shown in some short overall views (with some computer modifications to erase modern influences).The castle is also used for the 2015 movie "Emperor", starring Adrien Brody.

  <page name="Harley Street">Harley Street is a street in Marylebone, central London, which has been noted since the 19th century for its large number of private specialists in medicine and surgery. It was named after Thomas Harley who was Lord Mayor of London in 1767.Since the 19th century, the number of doctors, hospitals, and medical organizations in and around Harley Street has greatly increased. Records show that there were around 20 doctors in 1860, 80 by 1900, and almost 200 by 1914. When the National Health Service was established in 1948, there were around 1,500. Today, there are more than 3,000 people employed in the Harley Street area, in clinics, medical and paramedical practices, and hospitals such as The Harley Street Clinic, The London Women's Clinic and The London Clinic.It has been speculated that doctors were originally attracted to the area by the development of commodious housing and central proximity to the important railway stations of Paddington, Kings Cross, St Pancras, Euston and, later, Marylebone. The nearest Tube stations are Regent's Park and Oxford Circus.Harley Street is part of the Howard de Walden Estate.Many famous people have lived or practised in Harley Street, including the Victorian Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone, the artist J.

It extends from the south of the mouth of the Swan River at Fremantle for about 25 km to Cape Peron near Rockingham and is located at . The total area of the sound is about 100 km².It is bounded on the east by the mainland suburbs of Cockburn and Kwinana, on the west by Garden Island and Carnac Island, and includes several rocky outcrops and reefs. The Gage Roads shipping channel lies to the north.The sound was named in 1827 by Captain James Stirling, probably after Admiral Sir George Cockburn.The Perth Seawater Desalination Plant can be found here.Several media reports have been made on pollution of the water in Cockburn Sound, where in late 2015 an estimated 2,100 fish died as a result of algal blooms through poor local water quality.Reports from 2010 suggest the monitoring of pollutants was not adequate, using degradation of sea-grass since 2005 as a key indicator.Media coverage in December 2016 indicates the leaking of firefighting chemicals from the local defence base at Garden Island could be a factor, however the report was only made available in September 2016. Prior official reports indicate the water quality was improving, however there is doubt towards the scope of the report, as it does not include factors such as thermal stress from increased water temperature and oxygen stress as a result of climate change and localised desalination.

The 1 point for the King of the Mountain competition was claimed by Frenchman, Cyril Lemoine of Cofidis.Several suggestions have been made for the origins of the name "Blubberhouses":-Blubberhouses is used as a key setting for local composer Andy Tillison's composition "Le Sacre Du Travail", a five movement electric sinfonia recorded by the progressive rock ensemble The Tangent. The work is, according to the CD sleeve notes, loosely based around Igor Stravinsky's "Le Sacre Du Printemps" (The Rite Of Spring). One section of the second movement is named "Dawn At Blubberhouses" and the village is mentioned by name in the lyrics/libretto. A short story in the CD sleeve describes the journey of a man travelling to work through the village in the small hours of the morning. The CD album was released in 2013 by the German record label Inside Out Music.

Population:The estate of Gorki belonged to various Muscovite noblemen from the 18th century. Zinaida Morozova, the widow of Savva Morozov, purchased it in 1909, the year before she married General Anatoly Reinbot (later Anatoly Rezvoy), the Moscow head of police. She engaged the most fashionable Russian architect, Fyodor Schechtel, to remodel the mansion in the then current Neoclassical style, complete with a six-column Ionic portico.After the Soviet government moved to Moscow in 1918, it nationalized the luxurious estate and converted it into Vladimir Lenin's dacha. In September 1918, the Soviet leader recuperated there following an assassination attempt. He spent an increasing amount of time there as his health declined over the following years. On May 15, 1923, Lenin followed medical advice and left the Moscow Kremlin for Gorki. He lived there in semi-retirement until his death on January 21, 1924.After Lenin's death, Gorki was renamed "Gorki Leninskiye" (meaning "Lenin's Gorki"). The house became a museum holding many of Lenin's possessions. Also located on the estate are a large museum built in 1987 concerning Lenin's life there, containing such artifacts as his Last Testament (as transcribed by Nadezhda Krupskaya), other documents, photos, books, Lenin's personal car (a Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost), his wheelchairs, and his apartment and office from the Kremlin, reconstructed in a separate building. A monument representing "The Death of the Leader" was unveiled in the 18th-century park in 1958.

  <page name="Kokura">The Ogasawara and Hosokawa clans were "daimyōs" at Kokura Castle during the Edo period (1603–1868).Miyamoto Musashi, samurai swordsman, author of "The Book of Five Rings" and founder of the Hyoho Niten Ichi-ryū, famous for its use of two swords, lived in the Kokura castle under the patronage of the Ogasawara and Hosokawa clans briefly during 1634.After the end of the Tokugawa Shogunate, Kokura was the seat of government for Kokura Prefecture.When the municipal system of cities, towns and villages was introduced, Kokura Town was one of 25 towns in the prefecture, which later merged with Fukuoka Prefecture. Kokura was upgraded to city status in 1900.Kokura was the backup target for the "Little Boy" bomb on August 6, 1945, so if Hiroshima had been clouded over, the first atomic bomb would have been dropped on Kokura. Kokura was the primary target for the "Fat Man" bomb on August 9, 1945, but on the morning of the raid, the city was obscured by clouds and smoke from the firebombing of the neighboring city of Yahata the day before. Since the mission commander Major Charles Sweeney had orders to drop the bomb visually and not by radar, he diverted to the secondary target, Nagasaki.When the city of Kitakyushu was created in 1963, Kokura was divided into Kokura Kita ward in the north, and Kokura Minami ward in the south.The Gion Festival of Kokura is called the "Gion of Drums" and celebrates the life of local folk-hero Muhomatsu.The city is the site of the main dojo (honbu) of Miyamoto Musashi's sword school, Hyoho Niten Ichi-ryū.

  <page name="Della Falls">Della Falls is a waterfall in Strathcona Provincial Park on Vancouver Island and is among the tallest waterfalls in Canada.Della Falls is located 60 km (37 mi) from the city of Port Alberni, British Columbia in Strathcona Provincial Park.The only way to reach Della Falls, other than by helicopter, is by crossing the entire Great Central Lake by boat; the only road access to the lake is at the opposite side from Strathcona Park. After the 35 km (21 mi) crossing, there is a dock that marks the beginning of Strathcona Park, and a camping area which can be used as a base camp before trying the next 15 km (9 mi) ascent to the base of Della Falls. More campsites are available along the trail and near the base of the falls. The hike, part of which follows an old logging railway, takes about seven hours one way and is suitable for intermediate level hikers. It ranks 16th in the world in terms of vertical drop.In 1899, prospector and trapper Joe Drinkwater discovered Della Falls and named them after his wife. Drinkwater also built a 16 km (10 mi) hiking trail to the falls via Drinkwater Creek. Evidence of his gold mining operation, including an aerial tramway he built, can still be seen near the falls.With the highest total vertical drop, measured at 440 metres (1443 ft), Della Falls is considered by many to be the highest waterfall in Canada, though several other waterfalls in British Columbia are thought to exceed 600 metres (1969 ft): Alfred Creek Falls, Deserted River Falls, Francis Falls &amp; Gold Creek Falls; this is not in vertical height, so they may not be considered the tallest.

  <page name="Newgate">Newgate was one of the historic seven gates of the London Wall around the City of London and one of the six which date back to Roman times. From it, a Roman road led west to Silchester, Hampshire. Excavations in 1875, 1903 and 1909 revealed the Roman structure and showed that it consisted of a double roadway between two square flanking guardroom towers.From the 12th century, at least, the gate was used as a prison for debtors and felons. This, the notorious Newgate Prison, was later extended to the south on the site of the modern Central Criminal Court on Old Bailey. The gate was demolished in 1767.It was once thought that Newgate was "New" since it was built after the Roman period but archaeological evidence has shown that it was of Roman origin; it is therefore possible that the gate was so named when the Ludgate became less used due to the building of the fourth St Paul's Cathedral in the early medieval period.Newgate Street, today part of the A40 London to Fishguard route, is mostly located within the city wall, leading west from Cheapside to the site of the old gate, and then continuing onto Holborn Viaduct at the point where the Old Bailey thoroughfare joins to the south and Giltspur Street to the north. A notable discovery here was a Roman tile inscribed with a disgruntled comment that "Austalis has been going off on his own for 13 days".To the north of the street are the ruins of Christ Church Greyfriars on the site of a medieval Franciscan monastery. To the south is Paternoster Square leading towards St Paul's Cathedral.

  <page name="Lake Kyoga">Lake Kyoga (also spelled Kioga) is a large shallow lake in Uganda, about in area and at an elevation of 1,033 metres. The Victoria Nile flows through the lake on its way from Lake Victoria to Lake Albert. The main inflow from Lake Victoria is regulated by the Nalubaale Power Station in Jinja. Another source of water is the Mount Elgon region on the border between Uganda and Kenya. While Lake Kyoga is part of the Great Lakes system, it is not itself considered a great lake.The lake reaches a depth of about 5.7 metres, and most of it is less than 4 metres deep. Areas that are less than 3 metres deep are completely covered by water lilies, while much of the swampy shoreline is covered with papyrus and water hyacinth. The papyrus also forms floating islands that drift between a number of small permanent islands. Extensive wetlands fed by a complex system of streams and rivers surround the lakes. Nearby Lake Kwania is a smaller lake but deeper.Forty-six species of fish have been found in Lake Kyoga, and crocodiles are numerous.Excessive El Niño rains in 1997–98 resulted in exceptionally high water levels, causing large islands of papyrus and water hyacinth mats to become dislodged on the lake and to accumulate at the lake's outlet into the Victoria Nile. This blockage caused the water level to become even higher, flooding about 580 square kilometres of the surrounding land (DWD 2002) and resulting in population displacement and severe socioeconomic damage. In 2004, the Egyptian government granted Uganda a gift of 13 million USD to streamline the flow of the Nile at Lake Kyoga. , the outlet was still largely blocked.

Surrounding villages expanded rapidly as rows of miners' cottages were erected to accommodate the influx of people, most of whom came - in search of money - from Ireland and the Highlands of Scotland.This growth continued until the oil industry went into terminal decline in the 1920s and only post war industrial development at Greendykes and East Mains Industrial Estates, coupled with new employment throughout the West Lothian district and increased commuting to Edinburgh, helped to offset the depression that followed.Paul di Resta, the DTM champion 2010, and Formula One race driver in 2011-13 with the Force India F1 Team was born in Uphall on April 16, 1986.

  <page name="Tsugaru Strait">The is a strait between Honshu and Hokkaido in northern Japan connecting the Sea of Japan with the Pacific Ocean. It was named after the western part of Aomori Prefecture. The Seikan Tunnel passes under it at its narrowest point 12.1 miles (19.5 km) between Tappi Misaki on the Tsugaru Peninsula in Aomori Prefecture, Honshu, and Shirakami Misaki on the Matsumae Peninsula in Hokkaido.Japan's territorial waters extend to three nautical miles (5.6 km) into the strait instead of the usual twelve, reportedly to allow nuclear-armed United States Navy warships and submarines to transit the strait without violating Japan's prohibition against nuclear weapons in its territory.The Tsugaru Strait has eastern and western necks, both approximately 20 km across with maximum depths of 200 m and 140 m respectively.In the past, the most common way for passengers and freight to cross the strait was on ferries, approximately a four-hour journey.On September 26, 1954, 1,172 lives were lost when the ferry "Tōya Maru" sank in the strait.Thomas Blakiston, an English explorer and naturalist, noticed that animals in Hokkaido were related to northern Asian species, whereas those on Honshu to the south were related to those from southern Asia. The Tsugaru Strait was therefore established as a major zoogeographical boundary, and became known as the "Blakiston Line".

  <page name="Boveney">Boveney is a village in Buckinghamshire, England, near Windsor.The village name is Anglo-Saxon in origin and means "above island". This refers to the island in the River Thames next to the village. The Anglo-Saxon name for the village was "Bufanege".Boveney was once a hamlet within the parish of Burnham, though it has long since been considered a separate village, particularly since the urban growth of nearby Slough. It became a separate civil parish in 1866, having been a chapelry before, and was part of Eton Rural District from 1894 to 1934. In 1934 the parish of Boveney was abolished, under a County Review Order, with the more urbanised part being added to Eton Urban District, and a larger, less populous part being added to the parish of Dorney (where the 2011 Census population was included).The Church of St Mary Magdalene is in a remote part of the village by the River Thames. This church was used as a location for many Hammer Horror movies which were made at nearby Bray Studios. In 1983 the church was declared redundant and vested in the care of the Friends of Friendless Churches, who repair and conserve it for visitors and local people to enjoy. In 2004 a major campaign was undertaken to repair the 14th century timber-framed tower and a further programme of repairs was planned for 2007, so the church was closed to visitors.Many TV and film companies use the village as a location.

  <page name="Cairo Governorate">Cairo Governorate ( "") is the most populated of the governorates of Egypt. Its capital, the city of Cairo, is the national capital of Egypt, and is part of the Greater Cairo metropolitan area. Because it is completely urbanized, the governorate is considered a city proper, and functions as a municipality. However, there are uninhabited desert areas.Parts of the governorate were separated in April 2008 to form the Helwan Governorate (reincorporated into the Cairo Governorate in April 2011).The Cairo Governorate is divided into 41 administrative divisions, called "qism" in Arabic.The current Governor is Galal Saeed, who previously served as Minister of Transport under Kamal Ganzouri.According to the Egyptian Governing Authority for Investment and Free Zones (GAFI), in affiliation with the Ministry of Investment (MOI), the following industrial zones are located in this governorate:Due to its congestion and overcrowded streets Cairo is not attractive to investors. UN-Habitat is promoting alternative methods of transportation with the aim of relieving these issues.In a program that began on August 28, 2012 (through 2018), the European Union invested 40 million Euros on upgrading the infrastructure of informal areas in Cairo Governorate.

  <page name="Chearsley">Chearsley is a village and civil parish within Aylesbury Vale district in Buckinghamshire, England. It is situated about seven miles south west of Aylesbury, and about four miles north of Thame, in Oxfordshire.The village was mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 as "Cerdeslai". It was originally a hamlet in the nearby parish of Crendon.It was established as a parish in its own right by the Bishop of Lincoln in 1458.The village name is Anglo Saxon in origin, and means 'Cerdic's clearing' or 'Cerdic's lea'.The incidence of Brittonic personal names in the royal genealogies of a number of "Anglo-Saxon" dynasties is significant. The Wessex royal line was traditionally founded by a man named Cerdic, an undoubtedly Brittonic name ultimately derived from Caratacus. This may indicate that Cerdic was a native Briton, and that his dynasty became anglicised over time.The village was used as a location in the television series Midsomer Murders – ep.

In the 19th century the prefix was dropped and the two villages became known as Chenies and Latimer.Near this village there was once a royal hunting-box, where both King Edward I and King Edward II were known to have resided. It was the owner of this lodge, Edward III's shield bearer, Thomas Cheyne, who first gave his name to the village and his descendant, Sir John Cheyne, who built Chenies Manor House in around 1460 on the site.Several paper mills were once established in Chenies, operated by the River Chess, which flowed here from further west in Buckinghamshire.The parish church of St Michael includes the Bedford Chapel (photo), burial place of many notable members of the Russell family. The church is not of great architectural interest but stands in an attractive position in the Chess Valley near the manor house.

In the Domesday Book of 1086, the village was recorded as "Cicelai".The manor of Chicheley (which some suggest may have once been called Thickthorn) anciently belonged to the Pagnell family of Newport Pagnell, but was given by them to the church. Through this connection the village also at one time belonged to Cardinal Wolsey, though only until his forced resignation by King Henry VIII who took all his possessions from him at that time.During the English Civil War, the manor, belonging to the Chester family, received some considerable damage, associated as it was with the garrison at Newport Pagnell. Following the civil war, the manor was demolished, and the present Chicheley Hall built on the site. All that remains of the old manor today is one Jacobean over-mantel with termini caryatids, and some panelling in the 'new' Chicheley Hall.The parish church is dedicated to St Lawrence and has a perpendicular style central tower with large windows. The chancel, which contains a fine plaster depicting floral wreaths in relief, and a stone reredos, was rebuilt c. 1708; however, the church dates from the 14th century. In the nave are raised box pews, giving a theatrical air. The church contains monuments to Anthony Cave. Cave's sarcophagus is a cadaver tomb. Other monuments dating from 1635 are to the Chester family of Chicheley Hall.

The tower is thought to be Norman; however, the top is later probably 14th century. The majority of the building is of the 13th, 14th and 15th centuries and the nave is unusually tall. Features of interest include the 14th-century font and the medieval monuments of the Reynes family. These include two pairs of wooden effigies; one pair is of Ralph and Amabel de Reynes (ca. 1320–30) and the other is unidentified and slightly earlier.

  <page name="Carnac Island">Carnac Island is a , A Class, island nature reserve about south-west of Fremantle in Western Australia.In 1803, French explorer Louis de Freycinet, captain of the "Casuarina", named the island "Île Pelée" ("Bald Island"). It was also known as "Île Lévilian" and later "Île Berthelot". In 1827, James Stirling changed its name to "Pulo Carnac Island" in honour of John Rivett Carnac, Second Lieutenant on his ship HMS "Success". "Pulo" is Malay for "Island"; it is not known why Stirling included the term, and it was soon dropped. In the early days of the Swan River Colony the island was used as a penal settlement for Indigenous Australians.The island is home to Australian sea lions, bottlenose dolphins and a large range of marine bird life. It is particularly noted for the abundance of snakes, particularly tiger snakes, which live there. For this reason, very few people venture there. There is no permanent fresh water, providing a challenge for the animals that live there. The origins of the tiger snake colony has attracted significant debate and research into how that species has adapted to a harsh island habitat.Carnac is classified as an Important Bird Area because it supports a large colony of the vulnerable fairy tern, as well as small numbers of other nesting seabirds.

The village is built around a central "terp", a man-made mound between 4 and 8 feet tall built to provide relief from the high tides of the sea before dykes were constructed around the 10th century.Dutch writer Geert Mak used Jorwert as the hook for his book "Jorwerd: The Death of the Village in late 20th century Europe" (ISBN 1-86046-803-9) - though the Dutch title "Hoe God verdween uit Jorwerd" translates as "How God disappeared from Jorwerd". Mak describes the changes that have affected the village over the last century, and writes eloquently about the people and their experiences.The centre of the village is the "Redbad church", which dates back to the 12th century. The church tower collapsed in 1951, but has since been rebuilt; the action to raise funds for the restoration included an open air play, which is still held every summer in the garden of the local notary.

  <page name="Kabir Kuh">Kabir Kuh (In Persian: کبیرکوه In Kurdish: کڤەر -Kiver) is one of the long ranges of the Zagros Mountains near the border of Lurestan and Ilam Provinces in Ilam province, Iran. Covering an area of , Kabir Kuh stretches in length and in width along the Zagros Mountains in the Northwest-Southeast direction. It begins about south of Ilam and stretches down to the vicinity of Andimeshk in Khuzestan. Made mainly by Cretaceous sedimentary rocks, the Kabir Kuh range consists of a large number of mountains, including Shah Ahmad, Tabriz, Kaleh-bad, Filman, Damaghey-e Anar, Rivasan, Puneh, Sabzkhani, Zarrin, Golgol that are covered by snow and ice all year round. Its highest peak is Kan Seifi with elevation, south of Ilam. Kabir Kuh runs along the Seymareh river, which becomes Karkheh when joins the Kashkan river before reaching the border of Ilam province and Khuzestan province. Kabir Kuh divides the mountainous region in western Iran into two regions generally referred as Piškuh (eastern side) and Poštkuh (western side), the latter virtually coinciding with Ilam.The eastern side is dominated by steep slopes where water and wooded valleys abound. The western side is, however, quite dry but rich in oil reservoirs and underground resources.

  <page name="River Lugg">The River Lugg () rises near Llangynllo, Powys. It flows through the border town of Presteigne, Wales then through Herefordshire, England, including the town of Leominster, south of which it is met by a tributary, the River Arrow, then to a confluence with the River Wye, which it joins at Mordiford, downstream of Hereford and from its source.Below Leominster the river was made navigable under the "River Wye &amp; Lugg Navigation Act 1696" for improving the River Wye, and had pound locks. Despite several attempts to improve it, including making flash locks against bridges, the river was probably never a satisfactory navigation. Commercial navigation probably ceased in the early 19th century. It is still sometimes used by small boats, but can be very dangerous when in flood. The Environment Agency is the navigation authority for the river.The river is popular with canoeists who have undisputed rights of navigation. It is a good fishing river.

  <page name="Steeple Claydon">Steeple Claydon is a village and civil parish in the Aylesbury Vale district of Buckinghamshire, England. The village is about south of Buckingham, west of Winslow and northwest of Waddesdon. The 2011 Census recorded the parish population as 2,278.The toponym "Claydon" is derived from the Old English for "clay hill". The Domesday Book of 1086 records the area (including nearby Botolph Claydon, East Claydon and Middle Claydon) as "Claindone". The affix "steeple" refers to the steeple of the Church of England parish church, which is prominent in the village. The manor of Steeple Claydon was once a royal possession. It was given as a wedding gift to Robert D'Oyly by King Henry I because D'Oyly was marrying one of the king's former mistresses. Later, after changing hands several times it came into the possession of King Edward IV when his grandfather the Earl of March left it to him. The manor house has since been pulled down. Thomas Chaloner, a regicide, had a school built in the village in 1656. This site was later made into the public library.Steeple Claydon is now one of the largest villages in the Aylesbury Vale. It has three public houses, a Co-op supermarket with a cash machine, a newsagent, a bakery, a post office, a hairdresser, a fish &amp; chips shop, a dentist, a doctor's surgery and a garage. The village also has a successful football side, Steeple Claydon Football Club. The village has had some notable residents, including Florence Nightingale and Sam Baldock.The current Steeple Claydon School is a mixed, community primary school, which has about 150 pupils ranging in age from four to eleven.

The second highest at 7,654 metres on the NE side (Chogolisa II) is the one named Bride Peak by Martin Conway in 1892.In 1909, a party led by Duke of the Abruzzi reached from a base camp located on the northern side and a high camp on the Chogolisa saddle at 6,335m. Bad weather stopped the party from ascending further, but their climb established a world altitude record.Hermann Buhl and Kurt Diemberger attempted Chogolisa in 1957 after they had successfully summitted Broad Peak behind Marcus Schmuck and Fritz Wintersteller a few weeks earlier. On June 25 they left camp I and camped in a saddle at 6,706m on the SE ridge. On June 27 a sudden snow storm forced them to retreat and on the descent, Buhl broke off a big cornice and fell into the mountain's near vertical north face. His body has never been found.In 1958, a Japanese expedition from Kyoto University led by Takeo Kuwabara() made the first ascent of Chogolisa II, placing M. Fujihira and K. Hirai on top.The first ascent of Chogolisa I was made on August 2, 1975 by Fred Pressl and Gustav Ammerer of an Austrian expedition led by Eduard Koblmueller. Koblmueller almost suffered the same fate as Buhl, as he also fell through a cornice on the ascent; fortunately, he was roped and team members were able to pull him to safety.

  <page name="Bélapátfalva">Bélapátfalva is a town in Heves county, in Hungary, located north of the city of Eger. The town is located inside the Eger river valley at an altitude of 311 meters above sea level. Facing the town is the Bél-kő mountain which rises 811 meters and is one of the highest peaks of the Bükk mountains.The town is the site of the best-preserved Romanesque church building in Hungary, formerly part of a Cistercian abbey. The church was built after 1232 and later modified in Gothic style. The façade is notable for its Romanesque portal and the interplay between grey and reddish stone rows. The abbey to the south of the church was destroyed in the 16th century, and only its ruins remain. The design of the chapel of the Cistercian Our Lady of Dallas in Irving, Texas, was influenced by this church, which architect Gary Cunningham visited prior in preparation for the project.

  <page name="Mátra">The Mátra is a mountain range in northern Hungary, between the towns Gyöngyös and Eger. The country's highest peak, Kékestető (1014 m), belongs to this mountain range.The Mátra (Slovak: "Matra") is part of the North Hungarian Mountains and belongs by origin to the largest young volcanic zone of Europe. It is situated between the valleys of River Tarna and River Zagyva. The Mátra can be divided into several readily distinguishable parts. The highest point of the Western Mátra is Muzsla (805 m). The Central Mátra consists of the plateau of Mátrabérc (Mátra ridge) and the groups of the volcanic cones of Galyatető and Kékestető. Steep, rugged slopes, screes, talus slopes and slides alternate with one another, covered with closed beech forests. Gentler slopes and parallel valleys flow down to the south, the largest of which is the so-called Nagy-völgy (Great Valley). The 'main entrance' to the Mátra was formed in parallel with the valley of Nagy-patak (Great Stream), ranging from Mátrafüred to Mátraháza. From the vineyard-covered landscape of the foot of the Mátra travellers can arrive at the wooded mountains in a flash. To the east, after the steep escarpment of the 898-metre-high Saskő (Eagle Stone), the 650-750-metre-high peaks of the Eastern Mátra follow one another. The northern part of the mountain range is called Mátralába (the Mátra's feet). This is a hilly area covered with 250-400-metre-high small volcanic cones, with mostly cultivated arable lands.

It is located on the northern edge Barrio Anón in Ponce, close to the border with the municipality Jayuya, and is part of the Cordillera Central (Central Mountain Range). It is known as "El Cerro de los Mártires" ("Mountain of the Martyrs") and characterized as the most infamous peak in Puerto Rico, due to the 1978 Cerro Maravilla murders which took place here.The peak is located at the end of the 0.5 km-long Puerto Rico Highway 577, which is accessible via Puerto Rico Highway 143, traveling either westbound or eastbound. PR-143 is a secondary two-way, two-lane mountainous road that is relatively well traveled. The peak's coordinates are: .The height of the mountain makes for some interesting sights. For example, on clear days both the northern and southern coasts of the island can be appreciated simultaneously. In the winter season, the air is crisp and the temperature at night will usually fluctuate between the 40s and 60s degrees Fahrenheit. The chirping of the familiar "coquies" is prominent after nightfall.The peak might be best known for being the place where two Puerto Rico independence activists were slain on July 25, 1978 in a police ambush (see Cerro Maravilla murders.) This controversy has since turned the mountain into a meeting point for supporters of the independence of the Puerto Rican Commonwealth to gather annually to remember the murdered activists and condemn the current colonial status.The following table charts the climate at Cerro Marravilla throughout the year.

  <page name="Bedout">Bedout , or more specifically the Bedout High, is a geological and geophysical feature centered about 250 km off the northwestern coast of Australia in the Canning and overlying Roebuck basins. Although not obvious from sea floor topography, it is a roughly circular area about 30 km in diameter where older rocks have been uplifted as much as 4 km towards the surface. The Bedout High was penetrated by two petroleum exploration wells (Bedout-1, Lagrange-1) in the 1970s and 1980s. It is named after nearby Bedout Island.In 1996 Australian geologist John Gorter first suggested that the Bedout High might mark the centre of a very large buried impact crater up to 250 km in diameter, based mainly on its internal geological structure as revealed on a single seismic survey line, and suggested that it may be of near end Permian age, based on the reported age of volcanic rocks in Lagrange-1. The impact hypothesis was developed further by Luanne Becker (University of California) and coworkers who claimed to have confirmed that the supposed volcanic rocks in the petroleum wells are actually impact melt breccia showing evidence of shock metamorphism, and re-dated these rocks at 250.1 ± 4.5 Ma. The new age is essentially coincident with the Permian-Triassic boundary and associated extinction event, and Becker speculates that there is a likely connection. It was subsequently reported, based on very limited preliminary data, that the impact hypothesis is further supported by chromium isotope evidence for the presence of extraterrestrial material.The Bedout impact hypothesis has not been widely supported by impact cratering specialists. Specific counter claims include:

  <page name="Lammermuir Hills">The Lammermuirs ("An Lomair Mòr" in Gaelic) are a range of hills in southern Scotland, forming a natural boundary between Lothian and the Borders. The name literally means "lambs' moor". Early forms include "Lombormore, Lambremore, Lambermora and Lambirmor."Spanning the counties of Selkirk, East Lothian, and Berwick, the Lammermuirs extend from the Gala Water to St Abb's Head, and offer a traditional site for sheep grazing. The hills are nowhere especially high, the highest points being Meikle Says Law at and the Lammer Law at ; but steep gradients, exposure to the elements, and a lack of natural passes combine to form a formidable barrier to communications between Edinburgh and the Borders.The hills are crossed by only one major road (the A68), which crosses the shoulder of Soutra Hill between Lauder and Pathhead, and is frequently closed by snow in winter. The main road linking Edinburgh to England (the A1) avoids the hills by following a circuitous route around the coast.White Castle was an Iron Age hill fort, settled by the ancestors of the Votadini tribe.Two ranges of hills in New Zealand, the Lammermoors and Lammerlaws are named after the Scottish hills.Sir Walter Scott's novel The Bride of Lammermoor is set here.

  <page name="Blasket Islands">The Blasket Islands ("Na Blascaodaí" in Irish - etymology uncertain: it may come from the Norse word "brasker", meaning "a dangerous place") are a group of islands off the west coast of Ireland, forming part of County Kerry.The six principal islands of the Blaskets are:They were inhabited until 1953 by a completely Irish-speaking population, and today are part of the Gaeltacht. The inhabitants were evacuated by the government to the mainland on 17 November 1953 due to the declining population and harsh nature of life on the island. Many of the descendants currently live in Springfield, Massachusetts, and some former residents still live on the Dingle Peninsula, within sight of their former home.The islanders were the subject of much anthropological and linguistic study around the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries particularly from writers and linguists such as Robin Flower, George Derwent Thomson and Kenneth H. Jackson. Thanks to their encouragement and that of others, a number of books were written by islanders that record much of the islands' traditions and way of life. These include "An tOileánach (The Islandman)" by Tomás Ó Criomhthain, "Peig" by Peig Sayers and "Fiche Blian ag Fás (Twenty Years A-Growing)" by Muiris Ó Súilleabháin.The Blasket Islands have been called "Next Parish America", based on the erroneous idea that the next parish west of the islands would be the United States. The actual next parish west of the Blasket Island would be located in Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada.There is a ferry service that calls only to the Great Blasket and sails from Dunquin. This ferry service is mainly for day-trippers. Passengers are transferred to a SIB once the ferry gets close to the island, as there are no adequate landing facilities for a larger vessel.

According to downstream farmers in 2008, large cotton farms, such as Cubbie Station, have reduced the traditional flow of the Culgoa River by one third. By 2009, downstream farmers where claiming that due to upstream water entitlements on the Culgoa River, since 2000, the Lower Balonne floodplain had not received enough water to flood the plains. Prior to the granting of these rights, the Lower Balonne River flooded every two or three years; impacting the sustainability of flora, fauna, birdlife, and economic returns from grazing livestock and cropping.Little Culgoa Creek, an anabranch of the Culgoa River, leaves the river near Goodooga and returns to the river near Brenda Gate. The river flows through the Culgoa Floodplain National Park and the Culgoa National Park, located respectively north and south of the border between Queensland and New South Wales, west of Goodooga.Culgoa is an Aboriginal word meaning "running through" or "returning".

The population in 2006 was 24,710.The alternate name, Leribe, comes from the adjacent French Protestant Leribe Mission, founded in 1859 by François Coillard. Hlotse is also called Leribe because it is the camptown in the district of Leribe.The main Basotho Headquarters for Help Lesotho is in Hlotse.Three different sightseeing locations are the Leribe Craft Center, statue in front of the District Administration office, and an old military lookout.The Leribe Craft Center sells handmade wool items ranging from scarfs to jackets. The craft center is located on the side of the road as a person comes into Hlotse. The statue in front of the District Administration building dates back to English rule of Lesotho. It is located in the central part of the city. The old military lookout also dates back to English rule and is located in the central part of the city.

  <page name="Prasat Kravan">Prasat Kravan () is a small 10th-century temple consisting of five reddish brick towers on a common terrace, located at Angkor, Cambodia south of the artificial lake or baray called Srah Srang. Its original Sanskrit name is unknown. The modern name in Khmer, "Prasat Kravan", means "artabotrys odoratissimus temple". The temple was dedicated to Vishnu in 921 CE, according to an inscription on doorjambs.The site was cleaned from vegetation in the 1930s by Henri Marchal and Georges Trouvè. Afterwards the towers were restored on Bernard Philippe Groslier's initiative from 1962 to 1966, adding some new bricks which are marked with a "CA" (meaning "Conservation Angkor").The temple is oriented to the East and surrounded by a small moat. Its exterior is striking for its classical lines and symmetry. The central and the south tower have superstructures which take advantage of false perspective by simple means of diminishing tiers. The sanctuary's interiors are remarkable for the large bas-relief depictions of Vishnu and Lakshmi that have been carved into the walls of reddish brick, connected by a vegetable compound. This type of sculptured artwork is rather common in Cham temples, but rare in known Khmer monumentsThe bas-reliefs on the interior walls of the central tower are representations of Vishnu. There are three in all:The interior walls of the northernmost tower feature a pair of bas-reliefs of Lakshmi, Vishnu's consort, flanked by devotees:

  <page name="Zeebrugge">Zeebrugge (, from: "Brugge aan zee" meaning "Bruges on Sea", ) is a village on the coast of Belgium and a subdivision of Bruges, for which it is the modern port. Zeebrugge serves as both the international port of Bruges-Zeebrugge and a seafront resort with hotels, cafés, a marina and a beach.Located on the coast of the North Sea, its central location on the Belgian coast, short distance to Great Britain and close vicinity to densely populated industrialised cities make Zeebrugge a crossroads for traffic from all directions. An expressway to Bruges connects Zeebrugge to the European motorway system; one can also get to and from Zeebrugge by train or tram.It is Belgium's most important fishing port and the wholesale fish market located there is one of the largest in Europe.Aside from being a passenger terminal with ferries to the United Kingdom, the harbour serves as the central port for Europe's automotive industry, and it is important for the import, handling and storage of energy products, agriculture products and other general cargo. Zeebrugge has the largest LNG terminal complex in Europe.The harbour was the site of the Zeebrugge Raid on 23 April 1918, when the British Royal Navy temporarily put the German inland naval base at Bruges out of action. Admiral Roger Keyes planned and led the raid that stormed the German batteries and sank three old warships at the entrance to the canal leading to the inland port. This action blocked access to the port and prevented U-boats and other shipping from using it. The raid, although a morale boosting victory in Britain, was only a partial military success.Later, Zeebrugge's harbour was the scene of disaster when in 1987 the MS "Herald of Free Enterprise" passenger ferry capsized killing 193 people.

  <page name="Rib Mountain">Rib Mountain, also known as Rib Hill, is a glacially-eroded monadnock in central Wisconsin, located in the Town of Rib Mountain in Marathon County. Composed of quartzite covered with a softer syenite sheath, it was intruded about 1.5 billion years ago.Rib Mountain is near Wausau on the west side of the Wisconsin River, just west of Interstate 39 and just south of Highway 29. The nearby Wausau Downtown Airport at an elevation of 1201 feet, is located three miles to the east.Rib Mountain is almost long and peaks at above sea level and above the local terrain, making it the point with the greatest difference in height from peak to surrounding terrain in the state of Wisconsin. The Rib River and Little Rib River are nearby.Rib Mountain is home to the Rib Mountain State Park and the Granite Peak Ski Area. The peak is also the site of transmitters for radio and TV stations in the Wausau area, and is the namesake for Wisconsin Public Television's WHRM-TV (Channel 20) and WHRM-FM (90.9), Wisconsin Public Radio's news and classical network station for the area.It also makes room for the transmitter at the top for WIFC.Local legend states that the "ribs" in Rib Mountain denote that it is the burial site of Paul Bunyan. The nearby Mosinee Hill is said to be the grave of Babe the Blue Ox.When the ski area opened on the slopes of Rib Mountain in 1937, it was one of the first ski areas in North America. Stowe Mountain Resort in Vermont had opened a few years earlier in 1934. Sun Valley in Idaho had become the nation's first ski area in the western states in 1936.

  <page name="Mohale's Hoek">Mohale's Hoek is the capital city of Mohale's Hoek District in Lesotho. It had a population of approximately 24,992 in 2006.Mohale's Hoek had first been inhabited by the San who were found there by the Baphuthi around 1795. The Baphuthi settled in Kubake near the present Likuena High School while some settled at Thaba-Ts'oeu. Chief Moorosi of the Baphuthi is said to have been there during the journey to this new home. They later settled below the foothills of Thaba-Linoha, north of the present Bethesda mission and the area was later called Maphutseng. Some Baphuthi inhabited the area bordering Senqu River, Morifi and across the river into what is now Quthing. After 1824, the area was inhabited by Mohale, the younger brother of Moshoeshoe around the 1830s.On expansion of Moshoeshoe's kingdom into southern Lesotho, King Moshoeshoe sent his brother Mohale to administer the area where the Baphuthi and Basotho enjoyed a rather fragile friendship. After living for a while at Lifateng, Mohale established a substantial village at the place now known as Old Hoek (the present day Ha Ts'epo village) a few kilometres north of the present town. This village was destroyed in 1867 during the Seqiti War and was subsequently abandoned. In the year after the proclamation that made Lesotho British territory, an assistant commissioner was appointed to administer what was then called Cornet Spruit District - after the Makhaleng River. This would make Mohale's Hoek the second oldest of all the district headquarters towns in Lesotho, except that the town was completely destroyed during the Gun War of 1880. East to the town near the St Patrick's Cathedral are the Motlejoeng caves which were used by the celebrated cannibal, Motlejoa during the Lifaqane.

  <page name="Quthing">Moyeni is the capital city or camptown of Quthing District in Lesotho. Quthing was established in 1877, abandoned in the Gun War of 1880, and then rebuilt at its present site – the southernmost town in Lesotho. It has a population of approximately 15 000 (2004).Quthing district is home to a diverse group of people who speak different languages. King Moorosi, the leader of the Baphuthi people, who occupied the Quthing District in southeastern Basutoland (today's Lesotho) in the 1800s, died on Mount Moorosi in1879 in a war against the Cape Colony. A full description of the war and the events that led up to it are available in "'Moorosi: A South African king's battle for survival'" by Graham Fysh. See http://www.moorosi.com.Impressive rock and cave art are to be found near Quthing, which were created by the San people who settled in this area. Quthing lies in the southern part of Lesotho and borders the Eastern Cape province of South Africa. The Senqu River flows through the district of Quthing as it makes its long journey to the Atlantic Ocean. The border post between Lesotho and South Africa is called Tele Bridge.During King Moshoeshoe's reign he allocated this part of the country mostly to the Baphtuhi people led by King Moorosi.

  <page name="Phnom Krom">Phnom Krom () is a 140 m high hill close to Siem Reap, Cambodia.Phnom Krom is located about 12 kilometers southwest of Siem Reap town.Phnom Krom hill is very rocky; local legend has it that the rocks were exposed by the monkey general Hanuman during a hunt for medicine in the Ramayana epic. The area beyond the temple’s west gate affords a spectacular view of the Tonle Sap lake.There is an Angkorian temple on top of the hill. It is a Hindu shrine dedicated to Shiva, Vishnu and Brahma.The temple was built at the end of the 9th century, during the reign of King Yasovarman (889 A.D.-910 A.D.).Oriented toward the east, the hilltop temple is enclosed by a wall built of laterite blocks. Along the walls' top runs a cornice. Gates bisect the walls at each of the four cardinal directions. Just inside the east gate are four small buildings arrayed in a north-south row, possibly formerly used as crematoria. Inside the walls on the north and south sides are three halls, now collapsed. The temple’s focus is three towers, also in a row running north to south. They sit atop a platform reached by staircases of seven steps. The southern tower is dedicated to Brahma, the central to Shiva, the northern to Vishnu. They are built of sandstone; much of their carving and detail has been lost to erosion.Phnom Krom is the southernmost of three hilltop temples built in the Angkor region during the reign of Yasovarman. The other two are Phnom Bakheng and Phnom Bok.Phnom Krom was at the southern end of the Phnom Krom railway, a narrow-gauge French colonial railway that was most likely constructed to take stone quarried on the now defunct quarries on Phnom Krom to Siem Reap.

  <page name="Burntwood">Burntwood is a town in Staffordshire, England, approximately west of Lichfield. The town had a population of 26,049 at the time of the 2011 census and forms part of Lichfield district. The town forms one of the largest urbanised parishes in England. Samuel Johnson opened an academy in nearby Edial in 1736. The town is home to the smallest park in the UK, Prince's park, which is located next to Christ Church on the junction of Farewell Lane and Church Road. The town expanded in the nineteenth century around the coal mining industry.Areas of Burntwood are Boney Hay, Chase Terrace, Chasetown, Gorstey Lea and Burntwood Green. Nearby places are Brownhills, Cannock, Cannock Wood, Norton Canes, Gentleshaw, Hammerwich and Lichfield.In September 2009 it was announced that a Burntwood man, Terry Herbert, had discovered a hoard of Saxon treasure with a metal detector in a field in the adjoining village of Hammerwich.

  <page name="Modoc Point">Modoc Point is a cliff on the east shore of Upper Klamath Lake, in Klamath County, Oregon, United States, approximately 15 miles north of Klamath Falls on U.S. Route 97. It is part of the larger cliff known as Modoc Rim or Modoc Ridge.The point is named for the Modoc tribe of Native Americans because it was assigned to them when they moved on to the Klamath Reservation, following a treaty in 1864. This area was then part of the reservation. Captain Jack and his band lived in this area from December 31, 1869, to April 26, 1870. Due to continued harassment by the Klamath, the Modoc left the reservation to return to their traditional territory to the south on the Lost River in present-day California. This was before the Modoc War (1872-1873).Klamath folklore frequently features this location; they called it "Kiuti" or "Muyant". It was also called "Nilakla", meaning "dawn" or "sunrise". William G. Steel stated that the point was known as "Nilakla", the Klamath word for "dawn" or "sunrise".Modoc Point was the namesake for a railroad station and post office just north of the point.

  <page name="Brixton Hill">Brixton Hill is the name given to a 1 km section of road between Brixton and Streatham Hill in south London, England.Brixton Hill and Streatham Hill form part of the traditional main London to Brighton road (A23). The road follows the line of a Roman Road, the London to Brighton Way, which diverges from Stane Street near Kennington, and led south from the capital, Londinium, to a port on the south coast.Prior to the late 19th century, the road was known as Brixton (or Bristow) Causeway. On the eastern side of the road, a series of tree-lined open spaces and front gardens make up Rush Common — an area of former common land that, although it is subject to a prohibition on 'erections above the surface of the earth' under an Act of Parliament of 1806, has seen some incursions for building.The name Brixton Hill has subsequently been given to the residential areas on both sides of the road, and since 2002, it has also been the name of an electoral ward of the London Borough of Lambeth.From 1891 until the 1950s Brixton Hill was served by a regular London tram service; it was cable-drawn until 1904 when it was replaced by a conventional electric tram. The tram depot at Streatham Hill, opposite Telford Avenue, housed the tram cars, horses and the steam-powered winding gear for the cable. It is now a bus depot.Another surviving tram shed, which can still be seen near the junction of Brixton Hill with Christchurch Road, was designed by London County Council Tramways' architect G. Topham Forest, and had a capacity of 30 trams.

  <page name="Rocciamelone">Rocciamelone (, or "Roche Melon") is a 3,538 m high mountain in Piedmont, Italy, near the border between Italy and France.Rocciamelone is located between Val di Susa and Maurienne, 50 km west of Turin.Its summit is the tripoint where the comunes of Usseglio, Novalesa and Mompantero meet. The international border crosses the "Glacier de Rochemelon" 1 kilometer north of the summit, making it appear that the border is not following the watershed precisely in this sector. However, the glacier is draped over a ridge that is the true watershed and is precisely followed by the borderline.According to the SOIUSA ("International Standardized Mountain Subdivision of the Alps") the mountain can be classified in the following way:The teutonic knight Bonifacius Rotarius (of Asti) made the first ascent of Rochemelon on 1 September 1358, to bring a small metal image of the Holy Virgin as a gesture of gratitude for having survived captivity in the Holy land during a war against the Muslims.The summit of Rocciamelone is the destination of a traditional pilgrimage, every year, on August 5. A three metre high statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary was erected there in 1899.Because of its easy access (the start of the summit trail can be reached in a 90-minute drive from Turin), its considerable height and the renowned panorama, this mountain is one of the most frequented of the western part of the Alps.

  <page name="Superstition Mountain">Superstition Mountain (, ) is located immediately east of the Phoenix metropolitan area in Arizona. It anchors the west end of the Superstition Wilderness. Although its precise origin is debated by geologists, many believe that the mountain was formed from volcanic activity as far back as 25 million years ago. The ash and basalt composed mountain was eroded by the elements to give it the unique form it has today, creating the prominent landmark and popular recreation destination in the region.The mountain, located near Apache Junction and Gold Canyon, Arizona, is easily accessible from U.S. Route 60 and State Route 88. It is a popular three season (fall, winter, spring) hiking area. Afternoon temperatures from June to September are usually in the range of 100 to 115 °F near the mountain. Day hikers often frequent the mountain during cooler months. The Lost Dutchman State Park is located on the western side of the mountain and includes hiking trails to notable formations such as the Praying Hands and the Flatiron. The Peralta Trail, on the southern side of the mountain, traverses Fremont Saddle and descends into the wilderness to the east of the mountain.

  <page name="White Peak">The White Peak is the lower, southern part of the Peak District in England. In contrast to the Dark Peak, the underlying limestone is not capped by impervious millstone grit, so caves and dry river valleys are common features of the area. The soils are poor and calcareous, creating grazing land for both sheep and cattle.Broadly speaking, the White Peak covers the Staffordshire Peaks, the Cheshire Peaks around Macclesfield and the Derbyshire Peaks from the Hope Valley southwards. The White Peak is one of 159 national character areas defined by Natural England; their defined area covers an area of and includes the area approximately bounded by Buxton, Castleston, Matlock, Wirksworth and Cheadle, Staffordshire.The largest towns in the White Peak are outside the area of the Peak District national park. These towns include Matlock and Buxton, while Bakewell and most of the villages in the park are in the White Peak area. Round the areas of Tideswell, Flagg, Chelmorton and Youlgrave, you can see long thin fields created by the enclosure of medieval strip fields. The region is rich in footpaths, bridleways and green tracks that give access to the area. Longer distance ones include the Limestone Way and the Pennine Bridleway, and former railway trackbeds such as the Monsal Trail, the High Peak Trail, the Tissington Trail and the Manifold Way.The area is of interest to geologists, since much of the underlying strata have been exposed by extensive quarrying, and can be seen in the old railway cuttings along the Monsal Trail through Monsal Dale and Millers Dale.Peak District

  <page name="Studham">Studham is a village and civil parish in the county of Bedfordshire. It has a population of 1,128. The parish bounds to the south of the Buckinghamshire border, and to the east is the Hertfordshire border. The village lies in the wooded south facing dip slope of the Chiltern Hills. The hamlet of Holywell is located to the north of Studham, and forms part of the same civil parish.In the Domesday Book of 1086 it was recorded as "Estodham". Studham's church celebrated its millennium in 1997.The ancient parish of Studham straddled the Bedfordshire/Hertfordshire border. In 1894 under the Local Government Act 1894, the parish was partitioned into two parts, one on each side of the county border. They were re-united as a single parish, when part was transferred from Hertfordshire to Bedfordshire, in 1897.The village currently has two pubs, the older of which, The Bell, dates till before the English Civil War. In the early 20th century, work to make safe the old well in the pub garden revealed discarded or hidden civil war weapons.The village still retains substantial common land that was not lost as a result of the Inclosure Acts. Studham Common was the site of the "Blue Man" extraterrestrial sighting incident in 1967.In the early evening of 23 May 1948 an ex-RAF Handley Page Halifax, registered "G-AIZO", and operated by Bond Air Services Ltd. carrying a cargo of apricots from Valencia, Spain, crashed at Studham.

  <page name="The Church Brew Works">The Church Brew Works is a brewpub in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA, set in the confines of a restored Roman Catholic church (formerly St. John the Baptist Church).The brewpub is located at 3525 Liberty Avenue in the Lawrenceville neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The church building was originally built in 1902, and had been used as a church until 1993. Its doors opened as The Church Brew Works on August 1, 1996, after the building underwent extensive renovation, necessitated by years of lying dormant after being officially deconsecrated by the Diocese of Pittsburgh in 1993.In 2012, "Pittsburgh Magazine" named it one of the best breweries in Pittsburgh.As of September 2007, three flagship brews are locally distributed: Celestial Gold (light lager), Pipe Organ Pale Ale (English pale ale), and Pious Monk Dunkel (Munich-style dark lager). The in-house selection is rounded out by a rotating Stout, four seasonals or specialties, and one varying cask-conditioned ale. Also available are Millennium Trippel, a Belgian Tripel (in champagne bottles and 5L minikegs) and Cherry Quadzilla, a Belgian Quadrupel (champagne bottles only).The Church's beers are brewed on a steam-jacketed 15bbl system built by Specific Mechanical Systems, Ltd. of Victoria, British Columbia.In 2012 the Church Brew Works won the Great American Beer Festival's Large Brewpub Brewer of the Year Award.In 2001, the Church Brew Works was listed on the Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation's List of Historic Landmarks.

  <page name="Skunk River">The Skunk River is a tributary of the Mississippi River in the state of Iowa in the United States.The Skunk River rises in two branches, the South Skunk ( long) and the North Skunk ( long). The headwaters of the South Skunk are in Hamilton County in north central Iowa. It flows roughly due southward, to the west of Interstate 35, and passes through the city of Ames, before turning southeasterly. In Keokuk County, it is joined by the North Skunk, which has its headwaters in Marshall County. It then proceeds southeastward and flows into the Mississippi about five miles south of the city of Burlington.The Sauk and Meskwaki referred to the Skunk River as "Shecaqua". This name was probably mistranslated; one early settler wrote, "I was informed by Frank Labisner, United States interpreter for the Sac and Fox Indians, that the name of Skunk River was a wrong interpretation. The Indian name was Checaqua. which, in their language is anything of a strong or obnoxious smell, such as onions. I think, that from the fact that the head waters of the stream abounded with wild onions, the interpretation should be 'Onion.'"Species of fish found in the Skunk River include smallmouth bass, gar, walleye, catfish, carp, bluegill, sheephead, bullhead, and largemouth bass.The "Skunk River Navy", founded and led by Iowa State University biology professor 'Admiral' Jim Colbert, contributes to monitoring the biological diversity of the South Skunk River, and some of its tributaries, near Ames, IA. Participation in the SRN is focused on students entering Iowa State in the biology major, and completely voluntary. The SRN has been operating each September since 1998 and during that time about 2,000 volunteers have removed over 71 tons of trash from the river.

  <page name="Rybinsk Reservoir">Rybinsk Reservoir (), informally called the Rybinsk Sea, is a water reservoir on the Volga River and its tributaries Sheksna and Mologa, formed by Rybinsk Hydroelectric Station dam, located in the Tver, Vologda, and Yaroslavl Oblasts. At the time of its construction, it was the largest man-made body of water on Earth. It is the northernmost point of the Volga. The Volga-Baltic Waterway starts from there. The principal ports are Cherepovets in Vologda Oblast and Vesyegonsk in Tver Oblast.The construction of the dam in Rybinsk started in 1935. The filling of the reservoir started on April 14, 1941, and continued until 1947. Some 150,000 people had to be resettled elsewhere, and the historic town of Mologa in Yaroslavl Oblast along with 663 villages have completely disappeared under water. In recent years however, it has been increasingly viewed as a typical example of Stalinism for its disregard of the interests of the local people affected by the project. Today the dam is less important for hydroelectric power supply (output is 346 MW) than it used to be, and the ecological damage caused by the reservoir is being reassessed.

  <page name="East Okoboji Lake">East Okoboji Lake is a natural body of water, approximately 1,835 acres (7.43 km²) in area, in Dickinson County in northwest Iowa in the United States. It is part of the chain of lakes known as the Iowa Great Lakes. The area was long inhabited by the Santee or Eastern Dakota Sioux. The lake was known after its Dakota-language name, "Okoboozhy", meaning reeds and rushes.The towns of Spirit Lake and Okoboji, founded as European-American settlements in the nineteenth century, sit along its western shore. They became notable after the Spirit Lake Massacre of 1857, when a renegade band of Sioux attacked the frontier settlements, in part for food, because they were suffering starvation during a severe winter with heavy snows. It was the last Native American attack in Iowa against settlers.Geologically, the lake, like its neighbors, is a glacial pothole, a remnant of the most recent ice age approximately 13,000 years ago.The lake is shallow, with an average depth of 10 ft (3 m) and a maximum depth of 22 ft (7 m). During the summer months, it is prone to stratification and to overgrowth with algae.The lake is a popular fishing destination in the region, especially for bullheads.The lake was the main setting of the fourth X-Files episode, The Conduit. However, the episode was filmed in British Columbia, with Buntzen Lake being used as Lake Okobogee.

  <page name="Tutayev">Tutayev () is a town in Yaroslavl Oblast, Russia. Population:Before 1918, it was called Romanov-Borisoglebsk (), and before 1822, when an order of the Tsar united them, there were two separate towns: Romanov (on the left bank of Volga River) and Borisoglebsk (on the right bank). Romanov has existed since the 14th century and Borisoglebsk—since the 15th century. In the 15th century, Romanov was ruled by the khans of Nogay Horde.The majority of the population lives on the right bank of the river (the former Borisoglebsk). The areas of town nearest to the Volga's right bank have many old wooden houses and historical buildings (including the Resurrection Cathedral), but further away from the river, Soviet-era apartment buildings predominate. There is no bridge across the Volga in Tutayev, so people have to use a ferry or, alternatively, travel north to Rybinsk or south to Yaroslavl to cross.Within the framework of administrative divisions, Tutayev serves as the administrative center of Tutayevsky District, even though it is not a part of it. As an administrative division, it is incorporated separately as the town of oblast significance of Tutayev—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts.

  <page name="Wrangell Mountains">The Wrangell Mountains are a high mountain range of eastern Alaska in the United States. Much of the range is included in Wrangell-Saint Elias National Park and Preserve. The Wrangell Mountains are almost entirely volcanic in origin, and they include the second and third highest volcanoes in the United States, Mount Blackburn and Mount Sanford. The range takes its name from Mount Wrangell, which is one of the largest andesite shield volcanoes in the world, and also the only presently active volcano in the range. The Wrangell Mountains comprise most of the Wrangell Volcanic Field, which also extends into the neighboring Saint Elias Mountains and the Yukon Territory in Canada.The Wrangell Mountains are just to the northwest of the Saint Elias Mountains and northeast of the Chugach Mountains, which are along the coast of the Gulf of Alaska. These ranges have the combined effect of blocking the inland areas from warmer moist air over the Pacific Ocean. The inland areas to the north of the Wrangell Mountains are therefore among the coldest areas of North America during the winter.The Wrangell Mountains include 12 of the 40+ Alaskan peaks over (see fourteeners and thirteeners):Other prominent mountains include:The mountains are named after explorer, president of Russian-American Company, and admiral Ferdinand von Wrangel.

  <page name="Three Fingered Jack">Three Fingered Jack, named for its distinctive shape, is a Pleistocene volcano in the Cascade Range of Oregon. It is a deeply glaciated shield volcano and consists mainly of basaltic andesite lava. Compared with other heavily glaciated volcanic peaks such as Mount Washington and Mount Thielsen, which display eroded volcanic necks as their cores, Three Fingered Jack's present summit is a narrow ridge of loose tephra supported by a dike only thick on a generally north–south axis. Radiating dikes and plugs from a series of overlapping cinder and composite cones that support this summit have been exposed by glaciation.The sole glacier is the unofficially-named Jack glacier, located in a shaded cirque on the northeast side at an unusually low altitude for the Oregon Cascades. The last cone-building eruptions were more explosive in nature than earlier shield-building eruptions, producing mostly unconsolidated strata. Cone-building eruptions ceased before the Pleistocene glacial period, allowing the expanded glacial cover to remove most of the cone.While sources disagree about who the first ascenders were affiliated with, some sources calling them "the Boys from Bend," others saying they were members of the Mazamas club, one source written by one of these first ascenders clearly states who was in the party and when they climbed. Ervin McNeal, Phil Philbrook, Armin Furrer, Wilbur Watkins, Leo Harryman, and Ronald Sellars were the first to ascend Three Fingered Jack on September 3, 1923.Three Fingered Jack is located in the Mount Jefferson Wilderness and is not accessible by paved road, but can be approached by the Pacific Crest Trail. It is regarded as extinct and has not been assessed for volcanic hazards.Several lakes can be found in the vicinity of Three Fingered Jack. These include Marion Lake, Mowich Lake, Duffy Lake, Santiam Lake and Wasco Lake, among others.

About 1,300 years ago (1,330 C years B.P.) a series of small spatter cones formed between Belknap and Blue Lake. North of these, a phreatic explosion blasted out the crater which is today occupied by Blue Lake. To the south are several cinder cones and associated lava flows, including Collier, Four-in-One, and Yapoah cones. Four-in-One Cone has been dated at about 1,900 years old (1,980 C years B.P.) while Collier is dated at about 1,500 years old (1,600 C years B.P.)A small crater east of Belknap Crater is Little Belknap. The trailhead is shared with Belknap crater located on the PCT, fifteen miles west of Sisters as Highway 242 tops the McKenzie River Pass. The hike is a short 4.4 miles round trip passing through dusty Kīpukas and large lava fields with sharp softball sized pumice stones.

  <page name="Anzoátegui">Anzoátegui State (, ) is one of the 23 component states of Venezuela, located in the northeastern region of the country. Anzoátegui is well known for its beaches that attract many visitors. Its coast consists of a single beach approximately 100 km long. Its capital is the city of Barcelona, and significant cities include Puerto la Cruz and El Tigre.Named after the great hero of Venezuelan independence, José Antonio Anzoátegui (1789–1819), this state has its own history. The city of Barcelona, which is currently the state's capital, was founded in 1677. The present Anzoátegui State was included within the Cumaná Province, which was itself part of the Captaincy General of Venezuela, along with some other provinces (Guayana, Maracaibo, Caracas, Margarita and Trinidad). In 1810, it was separated from the province. It was in 1909 that it acquired the present political distribution.Anzoátegui is located in the northeastern region of the country and is bordered by the states of Monagas and Sucre to the east, Bolivar to the south, Guarico to the west, Miranda to the northwest, and the Caribbean Sea to the north.Based on the 2001 census information, the estimated population of Anzoátegui State in 2007 is 1,477,900 inhabitants.Anzoátegui's economy is dominated by Venezuela's principal resource: oil. It houses the "Complejo Petroquímico de Jose", one of the biggest petrochemical facilities in Latin America. However, Anzoátegui also has thriving fishing and tourism industries.Anzoátegui comprises 21 municipalities ("municipios"), listed below:According to the 2011 Census, the racial composition of the population was:

  <page name="Salmon Bay">Salmon Bay is a portion of the Lake Washington Ship Canal—a canal which passes through the city of Seattle, linking Lake Washington to Puget Sound—that lies west of the Fremont Cut. It is the westernmost section of the canal, and empties into Puget Sound's Shilshole Bay. Because of the Hiram M. Chittenden Locks, the smaller, western half of the bay is salt water, and the eastern half is fresh water (though not without saline contamination—see Lake Union). Before construction of the Ship Canal, Salmon Bay was entirely salt water.East of the locks, Salmon Bay is spanned by the Ballard Bridge, a bascule bridge that carries 15th Avenue traffic between Ballard and Interbay. West of the locks, it is spanned by the Salmon Bay Bridge that carries the BNSF Railway railroad tracks between Ballard and Magnolia.

  <page name="King County Courthouse">The King County Courthouse is the administrative building housing the judicial branch of King County, Washington government. It is located in downtown Seattle, Washington, just north of Pioneer Square. The 1916 structure houses the King County Prosecuting Attorney, the King County Sheriff's Office (KCSO), the King County Council, the King County Law Library, King County Work and Education Release, and courtrooms for the King County Superior Court and the Seattle District Court. It is located just north of City Hall Park at 516 Third Avenue, between Dilling Way and James Street.An enclosed skybridge connects the courthouse to the King County Jail, and a pedestrian tunnel connects it to the King County Administration Building.In 1911, King County voters first turned down, then approved plans to build a new structure for county government. The site settled on had once been owned by city founder Henry Yesler.Architect A. Warren Gould proposed a twenty-three story tower to handle anticipated growth in county functions, but the county commissioners preferred a more modest beginning. Starting in 1914, a five-story steel frame and reinforced concrete structure was built, and dedicated May 4, 1916 as the five-story City-County Building. In 1930, six floors were added, and later a three story 'attic'. Modernization efforts in 1967 added air conditioning and heavily modified the appearance of the building. In 1987, the King County Courthouse was registered as a King County landmark, which limits the style of future remodeling of public areas to restoring the original appearance.After the 2001 Nisqually earthquake the Courthouse was seismically retrofitted. The extensive damage done to older buildings in the area by the 6.8 quake pushed the County to move forward with this project. Upon completion, murals and a treatment of the marble floor on the first floor of the Courthouse were noted decorative touches.

  <page name="Noss">Noss is a small, previously inhabited island in Shetland, Scotland. It is a sheep farm and has been a national nature reserve since 1955.Noss is separated from the island of Bressay by the narrow Noss Sound. It has been run as a sheep farm since 1900.Noss had a population of 20 in 1851 but has had no permanent inhabitants since 1939. The main focus of settlement on Noss was around the low lying west side of the island at Gungstie (Old Norse: a landing place). Gungstie was built in the 1670s and is currently used by the seasonal wildlife wardens. Another settlement at Setter, on the south east of the island was inhabited until the 1870s and now lies derelict. Among the few families living on Noss were the Booth family headed by Joseph Booth (1765–1847). Genealogical records indicate that he was occupied as a farmer and fish curer. Records show that he was resident on Noss as early as 1834.Noss has been a national nature reserve since 1955. The island is linked to Bressay by a seasonal ferry service, run by the wildlife wardens using an inflatable boat.Attractions on Noss include a visitor centre, the Pony Pund built to breed Shetland ponies, the Holm of Noss rock and the Noup cliff. The sandstone cliffs of Noss have weathered into a series of horizontal ledges making ideal breeding grounds for gannets, puffins, guillemots, shags, black-legged kittiwakes, razorbills, fulmars and great skuas. Otters are frequently seen around the island.

While at first sight, it appears to be Egil's island, "Egil" being a Norse personal name, the Gaelic "eaglais" (Celtic "eccles") meaning church, may be part of the root, as the island is dominated by a church of pre-Norse foundation. The island of Kili Holm just to the north, may represent "cille", a monastic cell.The island's population was 26 as recorded by the 2011 census a drop of almost a third since 2001 when there were 37 usual residents. During the same period, Scottish island populations as a whole grew by 4% to 103,702.Orkney Ferries sail from the island to Tingwall on the Orkney Mainland via Wyre and Rousay.

  <page name="Grulla National Wildlife Refuge">Grulla National Wildlife Refuge is located primarily in eastern New Mexico in Roosevelt County, southwest of the intersection of State Highway 88 and the Texas - New Mexico border about 25 miles southeast of Portales, New Mexico and southeast of the tiny community of Arch. A very small part of the refuge extends eastward into western Bailey County, Texas.The central focal point of the Grulla National Wildlife Refuge is an ephemeral salt lake or saline playa – a shallow basin that collects runoff from the surrounding drainage area during heavy downpours but then often dries completely due to evaporation. This playa lake has been known by various names. Current USGS topographic maps and most commercially available maps of this region refer to this saline playa simply as "Salt Lake". Back in the early 1880s, this playa was part of the DZ Ranch, and those familiar with the ranch often favor the name "DZ Lake". The lake is also frequently called "Arch Lake" after the nearby community of Arch, New Mexico, located around 6 km to the northwest.The word "grulla" is Spanish for crane. When wet, the playa lake provides habitat to sandhill cranes and the grasslands within the refuge provide habitat to other birds such as ring-necked pheasants, lesser prairie chickens, and scaled quails.The refuge has no facilities other than a parking lot and trails and is administered by Muleshoe National Wildlife Refuge in Texas. It was often used in the mid 2000s as a training site for the Eastern New Mexico University cross country teams.

  <page name="Swing bridge">A swing bridge is a movable bridge that has as its primary structural support a vertical locating pin and support ring, usually at or near to its center of gravity, about which the turning span can then pivot horizontally as shown in the animated illustration to the right. Small swing bridges as found over canals may be pivoted only at one end, opening as would a gate, but require substantial underground structure to support the pivot.In its closed position, a swing bridge carrying a road or railway over a river or canal, for example, allows traffic to cross. When a water vessel needs to pass the bridge, road traffic is stopped (usually by traffic signals and barriers), and then motors rotate the bridge horizontally about its pivot point. The typical swing bridge will rotate approximately 90 degrees, or one-quarter turn; however, a bridge which intersects the navigation channel at an oblique angle may be built to rotate only 45 degrees, or one-eighth turn, in order to clear the channel.The "Abtsewoudsebrug" in Delft, close to the Technische Universiteit Delft, is a bridge of this type.There's another one on the channel between Ghent (Belgium) and Terneuzen (The Netherlands) at Sas Van Gent.(n.b. "swing bridge" in New Zealand refers to a flexible walking track bridge which "swings" as you walk across)In the UK, there is a legal definition in current statute as to what is, or is not a 'swing bridge'The largest double swing-span bridge in the United States is the long, navigable span, clearance George P. Coleman Memorial Bridge.

  <page name="Hoosic River">The Hoosic River, also known as the Hoosac, the Hoosick (primarily in New York) and the Hoosuck (mostly archaic), is a tributary of the Hudson River in the northeastern United States. The different spellings are the result of varying transliterations of the river's original Algonquian name. It can be translated either as "the beyond place" (as in beyond, or east of, the Hudson) or as "the stony place" (perhaps because the river's stony bottom is usually exposed except in spring, or perhaps because local soils are so stony).The Hoosic River Watershed is formed from tributaries originating in the Berkshire Hills of Massachusetts, the Green Mountains of Vermont, and the Taconic Mountains. The main (South) Branch of the river begins on the west slope of North Mountain and almost immediately fills the man-made Cheshire Reservoir in Berkshire County, Massachusetts. From there, the river flows north, west, and northwest, through the towns of Cheshire and Adams, the city of North Adams, and the town of Williamstown. It then travels through Pownal in the southwest corner of Vermont, after which it enters Rensselaer County, New York. There, it flows through the towns of Petersburgh and Hoosick, where it passes over a hydroelectric power dam in the village of Hoosick Falls. (There are also dams in Johnsonville, Valley Falls, and Schaghticoke.) The river provides the northwest border of the town of Pittstown, then flows through the town of Schaghticoke with its villages of Valley Falls and Schaghticoke before it terminates at its confluence with the Hudson above the city of Troy.

Grimsay has a harbour at Kallin, which is the base to a sizeable shellfish industry, the island's main industry, mostly for lobster, prawns and scallops. Also in Kallin is The Boatshed, a marine repair facility which promotes traditional skills, and employs a full-time boatbuilder and trainee. Three generations of Stewart family built as many as 1000 boats from three sheds on Grimsay. Grimsay is encircled by a single-track road that links most of the island's small croft and fishing settlements together.There is a fine example of an Iron-Age wheelhouse on the northeast coast of the island at Bagh nam Feadag. It is one of the best examples of a wheelhouse on North Uist but does not appear on Ordnance Survey maps.

  <page name="Diffa">Diffa is a city and Urban Commune in the extreme southeast of Niger, near that country's border with Nigeria. It is the administrative seat of both Diffa Region, and the smaller Diffa Department. As of 2011, the commune had a total population of 48,005 people.Diffa marks the eastern end of the paved section of "Route Nationale 1", the main east west highway across Niger, although the section between Zinder and Diffa is only partially paved in places. RN 1 continues north to N'guigmi more than 100 km. Maïné-Soroa, the other major town of the Region, lies less than 100 km to the west of Diffa. The border with Nigeria, at the Nigerian town of Duji, is 5.5 km to the south of Diffa. Diffa Airport lies to the north of the town.In 2002, it was the centre of the first military uprising in the country since President Tandja Mamadou instituted civilian rule and led to a crackdown by the government against the civilian press.Refugees from Nigeria fleeing violence from Boko Haram have crossed the border, and are living with local populations in Diffa and surrounding areas. As of 11 June 2014, the nearby "village of Guessere's population has doubled. Its new residents all come from a Nigerian village located 3 kilometers from the border." These refugees hid after an attack, and crossed a river to escape.NIGER REPUBLIC provide a lot of shelter, food and lots of material to the refugee more especially people from Damasak who were kept at gagamari. In early October, 2,200 more people arrived from the Nigerian village of Gueshkar. In the first ten months of 2014, "over 62,000 people" fled to the Diffa region to escape fighting in Nigeria.

  <page name="Baleshare">Baleshare () is a flat tidal island in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland.Baleshare lies to the south-west of North Uist. Its economics and community were boosted by the building of a causeway in 1962. The causeway was built by William Tawse Ltd. The island is extremely flat by Hebridean standards, rising to only above sea level and known for its long sandy beach. It has a population of 49 living in two settlements: Samhla and Teananachar.The name means 'east farm' or 'east town'. The 'west town' may have been on land that was said to exist to the west of Baleshare, washed away in the sixteenth century, over which it was possible to walk to the Monach Islands at low tide. The Monachs are some to the west. Another story suggests there was once a land bridge to Kirkibost, to the north. The basis for this seems to be a reference in the Exchequer Rolls for 1542 that the valued rental had been decreased due to encroachment by the sea at some unspecified (presumably recent) date.Two prehistoric settlements have been uncovered, which contain the remains of a circular stone house and pieces of pottery, bone and metal. In common with other sites in the area, they are threatened by coastal erosion.

  <page name="Lake Thun">Lake Thun () is an Alpine lake in the Bernese Oberland in Switzerland named after the city of Thun, on its northern shore.The lake was created after the last glacial period. After the 10th century, it split from Lake Brienz, before which the two lakes were combined, as "Wendelsee" ("Lake Wendel"). The culminating point of the lake's drainage basin is the Finsteraarhorn at 4,274 metres above sea level.Lake Thun's approximate 2,500 km² catchment area frequently causes local flooding after heavy rainfalls. This occurs because the river Aare (), which drains Lake Thun, has only limited capacity to handle the excess runoff. The lake is fed by water from Lake Brienz to the southeast, which is 6 metres higher than Lake Thun, and various streams in the Oberland, including the Kander.In 1835, passenger ships began operating on the lake. Ten passenger ships, operated by the local railway company BLS AG, serve the towns of Interlaken and Thun; the Interlaken ship canal and Thun ship canal connect the lake to Interlaken West railway station and Thun railway station respectively.Following World War II and up until 1964, the Swiss Government disposed of unused munitions into Lake Thun. The quantity of munitions dumped is reported to be from 3,000 to more than 9,020 tons.

  <page name="Lake Morat">Lake Morat or Lake Murten (French: "Lac de Morat"; German: "Murtensee") is a lake located in the cantons of Fribourg and Vaud in the west of Switzerland. It is named after the small bilingual town of Murten/Morat on its southern shore.It is the smallest of the three lakes in the Seeland or Pays des trois lacs area of the Swiss plateau located at the foot of the first chain of the Jura mountains. The main tributary is the river Broye.Since the Jura water correction its water leaves the lake through the Broye Canal ("Canal de la Broye") into nearby Lake Neuchâtel that is connected to Lake Bienne through the Thielle canal. Thus all three lakes form a natural reservoir in order to retain overflow water from the river Aare that flows into Lake Bienne: in times of combined heavy rainfalls and glaciermelting in the Alps, the peculiar situation arises that the water flows backwards through the Thielle and Broye canals, preventing an overflow of the Grand Marais.

  <page name="Havre Boucher">Havre Boucher is a Canadian village in Antigonish County, Nova Scotia.Havre Boucher is one of Nova Scotia's 22 incorporated villages, offering its residents political control through an elected governing body known as a "village commission" which operates under the auspices of the Nova Scotia Municipal Services Act. The village takes its name from "Havre Boucher", a natural harbour that opens onto St. George's Bay to the north. The community has expanded from its original setting on the west side of the harbour to now encompass the communities of Auld's Cove, Cape Jack, East Havre Boucher, West Havre Boucher, Frankville and Linwood.Havre Boucher is largely rural and largely dependent upon the fishing industry and as a service centre for the surrounding area.Construction of the Canso Causeway, which opened in 1955, saw the Canadian National Railway mainline from Truro-Sydney being diverted from Linwood to an alignment north through Havre Boucher and Cape Jack, following the Strait of Canso to the causeway. Prior to that time, the railway ran from Linwood to Mulgrave where a ferry service operated to Point Tupper. Havre Boucher saw the construction of a large railway yard, which remains in operation today by the Cape Breton and Central Nova Scotia Railway.

  <page name="Phthia">In Greek mythology Phthia (; or Φθίη "Phthía, Phthíē") was a city in ancient Thessaly which was later incorporated into Achaea Phthiotis.Phthia is the home of the Myrmidones, the contingent led by Achilles in the Trojan War. It wasfounded by Aiakos, grandfather of Achilles, it was the home of his father Peleus, his sea-nymph mother Thetis, and his son Neoptolemus, who reigned as king after the Trojan War.Phthia is referenced in Plato's "Crito", where Socrates, in jail and awaiting his execution, relates a dream he has had ("43d–44b"): "I thought that a beautiful and comely woman dressed in white approached me. She called me and said: 'Socrates, may you arrive at fertile Phthia on the third day.'" The reference is to Homer's "Iliad" (ix.363), when Achilles, upset at having his war-prize, Briseis, taken by Agamemnon, rejects Agamemnon's conciliatory presents and threatens to set sail in the morning; he says that with good weather he might arrive on the third day "in fertile Phthia" — his home.Phthia is the setting of Euripides' play "Andromache", which takes place name Farsala after the Trojan War, when Achilles' son Neoptolemus (in some translations named Pyrrhus) has taken the widow of the Trojan hero Hector as a slave.Mackie (2002) notes the linguistic association of "Phthia" with the Greek word "phthisis", meaning "consumption, decline; wasting away" (In English, the word has been used as a synonym for tuberculosis) and the connection of the place name with a withering death, suggesting a wordplay in Homer, associating Achilles' home with such a withering death.

  <page name="Piscataqua River">The Piscataqua River (pronounced /pɪs'kæt.ə.kwə/) is a tidal river forming the boundary of the U.S. states of New Hampshire and Maine from its origin at the confluence of the Salmon Falls River and Cocheco River. The drainage basin of the river is approximately , including the subwatersheds of the Great Works River and the five rivers flowing into Great Bay: the Bellamy, Oyster, Lamprey, Squamscott, and Winnicut.The river runs southeastward, with New Hampshire to the south and west and Maine to the north and east, and empties into the Gulf of Maine east of Portsmouth, New Hampshire. The last before the sea form Portsmouth Harbor, one of the finest harbors in the northeastern United States, despite a tidal current of around . The cities/towns of Portsmouth, New Castle, Newington, Kittery and Eliot have developed around the harbor.Named by the area's original Abenaki inhabitants, "Piscataqua" is believed to be a combination of "peske" (branch) with "tegwe" (a river with a strong current, possibly tidal). The first known European to explore the river was Martin Pring in 1603. Captain John Smith placed a spelling similar to "Piscataqua" for the region on his map of 1614. The river was the site of the first sawmill in the colonies in 1623, the same year the contemporary spelling "Piscataqua" was first recorded.After the Allies' European victory in the Second World War, a German submarine flying a white flag sailed up the river, where New Hampshire state police received its captain and crew as POWs.The Portsmouth Naval Shipyard is located on Seavey's Island in Kittery, Maine, near the Piscataqua's mouth. The dispute between New Hampshire and Maine over ownership of Seavey's Island was settled by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2001, locating the state border at the center of the river's navigable channel.

  <page name="Gare de Paris-Est">The Gare de l'Est was opened in 1849 by the Compagnie du Chemin de Fer de Paris à Strasbourg (the Paris-Strasbourg Railway Company) under the name "Strasbourg platform." This platform corresponds today with the hall for main-line trains, and was designed by the architect François Duquesnay. It was renamed the "Gare de l'Est" in 1854, after the expansion of service to Mulhouse.Renovations to the station followed in 1885 and 1900. In 1931 it was doubled in size, with the new part of the station built symmetrically with the old part. This transformation changed the surrounding neighborhood significantly.At the top of the west façade of the Gare de l'Est is a statue by the sculptor Philippe Joseph Henri Lemaire, representing the city of Strasbourg, while the east end of the station is crowned by a statue personifying Verdun, by Varenne. These two cities are important destinations serviced by Gare de l'Est.On 4 October 1883, the Gare de l'Est saw the first departure of the "Orient Express" for Istanbul.The Gare de l'Est is the terminus of a strategic railway network extending towards the eastern part of France, and it saw large mobilizations of French troops, most notably in 1914, at the beginning of World War I. In the main-line train hall, a monumental painting by Albert Herter, dating from 1926, illustrates the departure of these soldiers for the Western front.SNCF started LGV Est Européenne services from the Gare de l'Est on 10 June 2007, with TGV and ICE services to north-eastern France, Luxembourg, southern Germany and Switzerland. Trains are initially planned to run at 320 km/h (198 mph), with the potential to run at 350 km/h (217 mph), cutting travel times by up to 2 hours.The following services currently call at Paris-Est:

  <page name="Ravenna Creek">Ravenna Creek is a stream in the Ravenna and Roosevelt neighborhoods of Seattle, Washington, whose present daylighted length of nearly is entirely within the Ravenna &amp; Cowen Parks.Ravenna Creek used to drain Green Lake into Lake Washington's Union Bay, but urban development and the lowering of the two lakes in 1911 and 1916 resulted in the disappearance of the creekbed between Green Lake and Cowen Park and between Ravenna Park and Union Bay. Ravenna Creek's current source is a wetland in the northwest corner of Cowen Park, at NE 62nd Street and Brooklyn Avenue NE. It is also fed by springs throughout Ravenna Park, and is joined there by a second branch which begins near the intersection of NE 65th Street and 23rd Avenue NE. Until 2006, the creek ended at a sewer grate where the park's trail system opened into a soccer field.A daylighting project completed in May 2006 disconnected the creek from the sewer system and extended its bed towards the southeast corner of Ravenna Park, at which point it enters a pipeline. This pipeline, which runs southward along 25th Avenue NE to the NE 45th Street viaduct, empties into University Slough, thereby reconnecting Ravenna Creek to Lake Washington.In 2008, a major sewage spill of of raw sewage flooded the creek in an accident caused by King County utility crews working nearby.

  <page name="Saltcoats">Saltcoats () is a small town on the west coast of North Ayrshire, Scotland. The name is derived from the town's earliest industry when salt was harvested from the sea water of the Firth of Clyde, carried out in small cottages along the shore. It is part of the "Greater Ardrossan" or "Three Towns" conurbation along with Ardrossan and Stevenston.The harbour was designed by James Jardine in 1811.Saltcoats is served by regular bus and train services. Primary bus services are provided by Stagecoach West Scotland, while rail services are operated by SPT.Although Saltcoats currently only has a single railway station, the town was once served by a second railway station to the north of the town, originally as part of the Lanarkshire and Ayrshire Railway. This station closed to regular services on 4 July 1932, and there is no trace of the station today bar a nearby bridge.Saltcoats is in the Ayrshire North &amp; Arran constituency in the House of Commons and Cunninghame North constituency in the Scottish Parliament. Both seats are held by the Scottish National Party.Historically, Ardrossan has been part of the UK parliament constituencies North Ayrshire (1868–1918), Bute and Northern Ayrshire (1918–1983) and Cunninghame North (1983–2005).

  <page name="Piz Buin">Piz Buin () is a mountain in the Silvretta range of the Alps on the border between Austria and Switzerland. It forms the border between the Swiss canton of Graubünden and the Austrian state of Vorarlberg and is the highest peak in Vorarlberg.Its original name in the Romansh language is "Piz Buin Grand". A similar but smaller summit nearby is called "Piz Buin Pitschen" at 3,255 m (10,680 ft). Piz Buin was first climbed on 14 July 1865 by Joseph Anton Specht and Johann Jakob Weilenmann, guided by Jakob Pfitscher and Franz Pöll. Piz Buin Pitschen was climbed three years later.Piz Buin can be reached from the Wiesbadener hut, crossing the Vermunt glacier, climbing up the Wiesbadener ridge and hiking over the Ochsentaler Glacier to the Buin gap. From the gap there is a zigzag walk to the top, with only a 20 m (65 ft) steep step to surmount before reaching the relatively flat summit space, which has an old wooden cross on the very top. The border between Switzerland and Austria crosses the summit from East to West.

  <page name="Phénix">Phénix (French for phoenix) was a small-scale (gross 264/net 233 MW) prototype fast breeder reactor, located at the Marcoule nuclear site, near Orange, France. It was a pool-type liquid-metal fast breeder reactor cooled with liquid sodium. It generated 590 MW of thermal power, and had a breeding ratio of 1.12 (12% more plutonium produced than consumed), but normally had to be stopped for refueling operations every 2 months. Phénix continued operating after the closure of the subsequent full-scale prototype Superphénix in 1997. After 2004, its main use was investigation of transmutation of nuclear waste while also generating some electricity. Phénix was shut down in 2009.Construction of Phénix began in November 1968. The first connection to the French national electricity grid was in December 1973.The ASTRID (Advanced Sodium Technical Reactor for Industrial Demonstration) reactor, with a power generating capacity of 600 MW, is likely to succeed Phénix in its role as a French-built sodium-cooled fast reactor and is also part of the international Generation IV reactor programme. A decision on construction will be made in 2019.

  <page name="Garvellachs">The Garvellachs (Scottish Gaelic: Garbh Eileaich) or Isles of the Sea form a small archipelago in the Inner Hebrides of Scotland. Part of the Argyll and Bute council area, they lie west of Lunga and northwest of Scarba and have been uninhabited since World War II.The islands include Garbh Eileach, Dùn Channuill and Eileach an Naoimh.The waters surrounding the islands are extensively used for leisure sailing. A good knowledge of the area is required, with weather conditions likely to change very quickly. Due to the array of separate tidal races produced by the underwater topography there are some treacherous stretches of water. These include the Grey Dogs between Scarba and Lunga and the Gulf of Corryvreckan, between Scarba and Jura in which is located the infamous Corryvreckan whirlpool, which is the third largest whirlpool in the world.The area is part of the Scarba, Lunga and Garvellachs National Scenic Area, one of 40 in Scotland.

  <page name="Volksbühne">The Volksbühne ("People's Theatre") is a theater in Berlin, Germany. Located in Berlin's city center Mitte on Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz (Rosa Luxemburg Square) in what was the GDR's capital.The Volksbühne was built during the years 1913 to 1914 and was designed by Oskar Kaufmann, with integrated sculpture by Franz Metzner. It opened on December 30, 1914 and has its origin in an organization known as the "Freie Volksbühne" ("Free People's Theater") which sketched out the vision for a theater "of the people" in 1892. The goal of the organization was to promote the naturalist plays of the day at prices accessible to the common worker. The original slogan inscribed on the edifice was "Die Kunst dem Volke" ("Art to the people"). During World War II, the theatre was heavily damaged like much of the rest of Berlin. From 1950 to 1954, it was rebuilt according to the design of architect Hans Richter.Frank Castorf became director in 1992. In 2015 the City of Berlin announced that Castorf will be replaced by Chris Dercon in 2017.

  <page name="Lake Abaya">Lake Abaya (Abaya Hayk in Amharic) is a lake in the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples' Region of Ethiopia.In 1896 Lake Abaya was renamed "Lake Margherita" after the Queen Margherita of Savoy, wife of King Humbert I of Italy by the Italian explorer Vittorio Bottego who first explored the region. The name "Lake Margherita" (Lago Margherita) is still used in Italy while is now obsolete in other countries.Lake Abaya is located in the Main Ethiopian Rift, east of the Guge Mountains. It is fed on its northern shore by the Bilate which rises on the southern slopes of Mount Gurage, and the Gidabo. The town of Arba Minch lies on its southwestern shore, and the southern shores are part of the Nechisar National Park. Just to the south is Lake Chamo. Lake Abaya is 60 kilometers long and 20 wide, with a surface area of 1162 square kilometers. It has a maximum depth of 13.1 meters and is at an elevation of 1285 meters. There are a number of islands in this lake, the largest being Aruro; others include Gidicho, Welege, Galmaka, and Alkali. The lake is red due to a high load of suspended sediments. Lake Abaya does not always have an outflow, but in some years it overflows into Lake Chamo.Savanna, known for its wildlife and birdlife surrounds the lake, which is also fished by local people. According to the Ethiopian Department of Fisheries and Aquaculture, 412 tonnes of fish are landed each year, which the department estimates is 69% of its sustainable amount.

  <page name="Lake Ngami">Lake Ngami is an endorheic lake in Botswana north of the Kalahari Desert. It is seasonally filled by the Taughe River, an effluent of the Okavango River system flowing out of the western side of the Okavango Delta. It is one of the fragmented remnants of the ancient Lake Makgadikgadi. Although the lake has shrunk dramatically beginning from 1890, it remains an important habitat for birds and wildlife, especially in flood years.Lake Ngami had many famous visitors during the 19th (and into the 20th) century. In 1849 David Livingstone described it as a "shimmering lake, some long and 20 [30 km] wide". Livingstone also made a few cultural notes about the people living in this area; he noticed they had a story similar to that of the Tower of Babel, except that the builders' heads were "cracked by the fall of the scaffolding" ("Missionary Travels", chap. 26). Charles John Andersson (who published "Lake Ngami; or, Explorations and Discoveries during Four Years' Wanderings in the Wilds of Southwestern Africa" in 1856) and Frederick Thomas Green also visited the area in the early 1850s. Frederick Lugard led a British expedition to the lake in 1896. Arnold Weinholt Hodson passed through the area on his journey from Serowe to Victoria Falls in 1906.Ngami Lacuna, a methane lake on Saturn's moon Titan is named after this lake.

Rijkswaterstaat, Staatsbosbeheer and the Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality are responsible for the administration of the island. Twice a year marine debris is cleaned from the island.Sediment deposition has caused the island to become significantly larger in recent years.Rottumerplaat is the northernmost point of the Netherlands.Rottumerplaat is a resting and forage area for sanderling, dunlin and Kentish plovers. Common eider, common shelduck, Arctic tern, common tern, little tern, Kentish plover, and ringed plover nest on the island. From 1996 the Sandwich tern nested on Rottumerplaat, but has since stopped doing so.In 1971 writers Jan Wolkers and Godfried Bomans each spent a week on the island. Their only connection with the outside world was a short daily radio relay with VARA radio presenter Willem Ruis, who stayed at a hotel in nearby Warffum. The interviews were broadcast as a radio programme, "Alone On An Island". For Godfried Bomans, the stay on the island was a disaster; he could not cope with the noise the many seagulls made and he was troubled by loneliness. Jan Wolkers however experienced his stay on the island as an adventure and kept himself alive by catching shrimps and eel, and boiling sea sandwort. He also rescued a young seal. Both authors published a book about their stay on the island.

The town of Needham, Massachusetts was named after Needham Market.It initially grew around the wool combing industry, until the onset of the plague, which swept the town from 1663 to 1665. To prevent the spread of the disease, the town was chained at either end, which succeeded in its task but at the cost of two-thirds of the populace. The town did not recover for nearly two hundred years, with the canalisation of the River Gipping in the late 18th Century and the introduction of the railway. Modern Needham Market contains two road names that are linked to the plague. Chainhouse Road, named after the chains that ran across the East end of the town. The Causeway, is a modern variation of 'the corpseway' so called because of the route that plague victims were transported out of town, to neighbouring Barking church for interment.The village contains many businesses; a post office and stationers, hairdressers, Bretts Bakery, Smiths Butchers, Pauls Hardware shop and many more.Notable Buildings in the town include:Needham Market has a Non-League football club Needham Market F.C. who play at Bloomfields, they have been very successful over recent years after reaching the semi-finals of the FA Vase.The town is on the route of the Dunwich Dynamo annual cycle ride.Needham Lake (a former gravel pit) provides leisure facilities and a wildlife habitat.The East Anglia Main Line railway runs through the town, with Needham Market railway station providing trains to Ipswich and Cambridge.

In the center stands the Hazuri Bagh Baradari, built by Ranjit Singh.The Hazuri Bagh is a small enclosure between the Alamgiri Gate of the Lahore Fort and eastern gate of the Badshahi Mosque. This garden was built by Maharajah Ranjit Singh in 1813 to celebrate the capture of the famous Koh-i-Noor Diamond from Shah Shujah of Afghanistan. The Serai Alamgiri formerly stood here.The garden was planned and built under the supervision of Faqir Azizuddin in the traditional Mughal style layout. After its completion, it is said, Ranjit Singh, at the suggestion of Jamadar Khushhal Singh, ordered that marble vandalized from various mausoleums of Lahore to construct a baradari (pavilion) here. Ranjit Singh vandalized other Mughal tombs and buildings to construct Sikh temples in Amritsar. This task of building baradari was given to Khalifa Nooruddin. Elegant carved marble pillars support the baradari’s delicate cusped arches. The central area, where Ranjit Singh held court, has a mirrored ceiling. Both the garden and the baradari, originally a 45-foot, three-storey square with a basement approached by fifteen steps, suffered extensive damage during the fratricidal Sikh wars and was only reclaimed and laid out according to the original plan during the British period. On 19 July 1932, the uppermost story collapsed and was never reconstructed.Every Sunday afternoon, people gather in the gardens to hear reciters recite traditional Punjabi Qisse, such as Heer Ranjha and Sassi Punnun, and other Punjabi Sufi poetry.The tomb of Muhammad Iqbal lies across from the garden outside of the Badshahi Mosque.

  <page name="Riksgränsen">Riksgränsen, "The National Border" in Swedish, is a ski-resort in Kiruna Municipality, Lappland, Sweden, 200 km north of the Arctic Circle. The skiing season is from February to June. From end of May the lifts operate under the midnight sun.Riksgränsen is a popular location for the winter testing of pre-production cars by various European manufacturers. Photo-snipers are prevalent, attempting to get the first spy-shots of new models, though their activities are frowned upon by local hoteliers who value the custom of the manufacturers. The same manufacturers frequently use the location for winter launches, bringing journalists from across the world to drive the new cars on snow-covered roads and on courses specially prepared on frozen lakes.Although the subarctic climate of the region is very cold, it has considerably milder winters than normally expected for an inland northerly area, due to its proximity to the warm North Atlantic Current. Summers do remain cool in spite of the midnight sun due to similar marine effects. With prevailing low-pressure systems taking precedence, the climate is snowy and cloudy. The deep snow cover and the time it takes for thawing prolongs the skiing season to the midnight sun window.

  <page name="Beaverhead River">The Beaverhead River is an approximately tributary of the Jefferson River in southwest Montana (east of the Continental Divide). It drains an area of roughly . The river's original headwaters, formed by the confluence of the Red Rock River and Horse Prairie Creek, are now flooded under Clark Canyon Reservoir, which also floods the first of the river. The Beaverhead then flows through a broad valley northward to join the Big Hole River and form the Jefferson River. With the Red Rock River included in its length, the river stretches another , for a total length of , one of the more significant drainages of south-western Montana.The name of the Beaverhead originates from Beaverhead Rock on the middle river. This rock formation was recognized by Sacajawea when the Lewis and Clark Expedition passed the area in 1805. There were also many beavers in the area at the time, but the name does not originate from the animal. In 1805, Captain Meriwether Lewis traveled up the Jefferson and Beaverhead first, but when the rest of the expedition came, a sign Lewis had left at the confluence of the Beaverhead and Big Hole telling them to follow the Beaverhead had been cut down by a beaver, and the expedition traveled up the Big Hole instead. As a result, the swifter current of the Big Hole swamped two of their canoes before they could travel back down to the confluence.Together with the Red Rock River, the Beaverhead forms the uppermost headwaters of the Missouri River, the longest tributary of the Mississippi River.The river is a Class I water from the Clark Canyon Dam to its confluence with the Jefferson river for the purposes of public access for recreational purposes.

"A dos French" literally means "of the French". In fact, it was Afonso Henriques, who had a hand in its nomenclature; in order to reward mercenary French crusaders who assisted his early campaigns, Afonso Henriques distributed some lands along the margins of the Tagus, living behind names that only hint at French influence, including Vila Franca and A dos Francos.The "Chapel of the Holy Spirit" was constructed by the Crusaders during the 12th century, who fell within the territorial influence of Óbidos.These foreign colonies including those in the Estremadura were favored by King Sancho, who also received complimentary immigrants from Flanders, who populated the northern parts of the Tagus.In 1747, the population of this village included twelve homes. By 1853, the parish had amassed a small cluster of 101 homes.

  <page name="Lamar River">The Lamar River is a tributary of the Yellowstone River, approximately 40 miles (48 km) long, in northwestern Wyoming in the United States. The river is located entirely within Yellowstone National Park.Prior to the 1884–85 Geological Survey of the park, the Lamar was known as the East Fork of the Yellowstone River. During that survey, Geologist Arnold Hague named the river for L.Q.C. (Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus) Lamar, then Secretary of the Interior (March 1885 – January 1888). The Lamar Valley, or the "Secluded Valley" of Trapper Osborne Russell and other park features or administrative names which contain "Lamar" are derived from this original naming.Osborne Russell in his 1921 "Journal of a Trapper" described the Lamar as follows:In 1869, the Cook–Folsom–Peterson Expedition encountered the Lamar River (East Fork) just upstream from the canyon section flowing into the Yellowstone and traveled upstream to the confluence of Calfee Creek where they camped on September 16, 1869.It rises in the Absaroka Range, on the eastern edge of the park, and flows northwest through the northeast corner of the park. It is joined by many tributary streams, including Soda Butte Creek and Slough Creek and joins the Yellowstone near Tower Junction, just below the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone.The river is a popular destination for fly fishing, and is widely known as one of the best places in Yellowstone National Park to view wildlife, especially grizzly bears and wolves. Three locations in the valley—Soda Butte, Crystal Creek and Rose Creek were the sites for the 1995 re-introduction of wolves into Yellowstone. The river flows through a portion of the park hit hard by the 1988 wildfires.

  <page name="Bay of Greifswald">The Bay of Greifswald or Greifswald Bodden () is a basin in the southwestern Baltic Sea, off the shores of Germany in the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. With an area of 514 km², it is the largest Bodden of the German Baltic coast.To the west is the island of Rügen; to the southeast, the island of Usedom; to the east, the Bay of Pomerania, and to the south, the German mainland. The bay is also joined to the Baltic Sea through the Strelasund, a narrow sound separating Rügen from the mainland. The bay's northern end is sometimes called the "Rügischer Bodden".The bay itself has a heavily indented coastline, making it a bay of bays. The headlands of Mönchgut (in east Rügen) and Zudar (in south Rügen) – the former actually being made up of several peninsulae – subdivide the bay into many smaller ones. The bay's main port is Greifswald. Amongst the islands in the east of the "bodden" are Vilm, Koos, Riems and the former island of Stubber, now a sandbank.The Bay of Greifswald is quite shallow, with an average depth of 5.6 m, and a maximum depth of 13.5 m. Its water is brackish rather than briny owing to inflow from rivers, and the Baltic Sea's complex hydrography (saltier water is generally found only at greater depths there). The average salinity is at 7 to 8 psu, ranging from 5.3 and 12.2 psu.Before German reunification in 1990, the Bay of Greifswald was a public watersports venue, unlike most of East Germany's Baltic coast. The local geography made it easy to keep watch over the bay, thereby thwarting those who thought to use it to flee the country. The place outside the Warsaw Pact nearest the bay was the Danish island of Bornholm, more than 100 km away.

South Padre Island was formed when the creation of the Port Mansfield Channel split Padre Island in two. The island is a popular vacation destination because the resort city South Padre Island is located on the island.Before expansion in North America, the island was inhabited by native tribes. Western settlement is considered to have been started by Padre Jose Nicolas Balli, who set up a cattle ranch early in the 19th century. He and his family were driven out by the Mexican–American War, and were unable to return because of the American Civil War.Most of the island was closed by the National Park Service until 1962, after which settlement was allowed and incomers began to establish an economy on the island and neighboring Port Isabel. By 1978 the island had a population of around 314 and a decade later it had a population of 1,012 and 111 businesses. Being mainly coastline, the island's main source of income is tourism, with tens of thousands of college students flocking to the island every Spring Break. In winter the island hosts "winter Texans": people (often retirees) from colder states who overwinter in the warm Texas climate. Isla Blanca Park, a preserve and recreational park, is located at the southern end of the island.

It separates the island of Wolin from the rest of the Polish mainland. The other two channels are the Świna and the Peene.About 32 kilometers in length, the Dziwna forms on the eastern end of the Szczecin Lagoon near the town of Zagórze, Kamień County. Flowing north, it passes the town of Wolin and then widens and forms a number of connected features. Towards the west the main channel of the Dziwna forms the large Kamieński Lagoon ("Polish: Zalew Kamieński"). To the east a side channel develops into the Zatoka Cicha ("Quiet Bay", known as "Die Maad" before 1949), flows north through the strait of Promna as it approaches the city of Kamień Pomorski, then rejoins the Kamieński Lagoon. Between these two channels stands the small, largely agricultural island of Chrząszczewo connected to Kamień Pomorski by a single bridge.The Kamieński Lagoon reforms into the well-defined Zatoka Wrzosowska ("Wrzosowska Bay"), narrows, then flows past the coastal city of Dziwnów for just a few kilometers as the Dziwna again before finally reaching the Bay of Pomerania.

An estimated people visit the waterfall annually.The waterfall is situated in the Girringun National Park as it descends from the Atherton Tableland, where the Stony Creek, a tributary of the Herbert River, flows over an escarpment in the Seaview Range. The falls initially descend over a small number of cascades before the horsetail drop. In total, the falls descend over . Based on the falls' single-drop descent, the World Waterfall Database places Wallaman Falls at 294 in its world rankings.The geological history of the formation may be traced back some 50 million years, when the uplift of the continental margin in the region created modern landforms. The Herbert River, which previously flowed west, began to cut through the terrain en route to its outflow in the Coral Sea. The gorge produced by this erosive action gradually retreated inland along the Herbert River's course at a rate of per hundred years. The river's tributaries were eventually left suspended by this action, forming their own gorges.

  <page name="Markowa">Markowa (, "Markova") is a village in Łańcut County, Subcarpathian Voivodeship, in south-eastern Poland. It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Markowa. It lies approximately south-east of Łańcut and east of the regional capital Rzeszów. The village has a population of 4,100; it was founded in the 14th century as "Markhof" by the descendants of Germans colonists.During World War II many families in the village hid their Jewish neighbours to help them survive the Holocaust. It is now estimated that at least 17 Jews survived the war in Markowa. Seven members of the Weltz family were hidden in the barn of Dorota and Antoni Szylar. Jakub Einhorn's family was hidden by Jan and Weronika Przybylak and Jakub Lorbenfeld and his family were hidden by Michal Bar. Two girls from the Riesenbach family were initially hidden by Stanislaw Kielar, before joining the other three family members in the attic of Julia and Józef Bar.On 24 March 1944 a patrol of German police came to the house of Józef and Wiktoria Ulma, where they found eight Jewish members of the Szall and Goldman families. At first the Germans executed all the Jews. Then they shot the pregnant Wiktoria and her husband. When the six children began to scream at the sight of their parents' bodies, Joseph Kokott, a German police officer (Volksdeutsche from Sudetenland), shot them after consulting with his superior. The other killers were Eilert Dieken, Michael Dziewulski and Erich Wilde. On the 60th anniversary of this tragedy, a memorial was erected in memory of the family.&lt;br&gt;

  <page name="Zakros">Zakros () is a site on the eastern coast of the island of Crete, Greece, containing ruins from the Minoan civilization. The site is often known to archaeologists as Zakro or Kato Zakro. It is believed to have been one of the four main administrative centers of the Minoans, and its protected harbor and strategic location made it an important commercial hub for trade to the east.The town was dominated by the Palace of Zakro, originally built around 1900 BC, rebuilt around 1600 BC, and destroyed around 1450 BC along with the other major centers of Minoan civilization. Extensive ruins of the palace remain, and are a popular tourist destination.Zakros is sometimes divided into "Epano Zakros" ("Upper Zakros"), the portion higher up on the hillside, and "Kato Zakros" ("Lower Zakros"), the part near the sea. A ravine known as the "Ravine of the Dead" runs through both the upper and lower parts of the ancient site, named after the numerous burials that have been found in the caves along its walls.Epano Zakros is from Sitia. The road passes through Palekastro where it doubles back towards the south. A comparatively large village, Zakros includes in its community the following smaller villages: Kato Zakros, Adravasti, Azokeramos, Kellaria, Klisidi and the small hamlets of Ayios Georgios, Sfaka, Kanava and Skalia. The asphalt road ends at Kato Zakros.Zakro was first excavated by D.G. Hogarth of the British School of Archaeology at Athens and 12 houses were unearthed before the site was abandoned. In 1961, Nikolaos Platon resumed the excavation and discovered the Palace of Zakro. This site has yielded several clay tablets with Linear A inscriptions.

  <page name="Makassar Strait">Makassar Strait is a strait between the islands of Borneo and Sulawesi in Indonesia. To the north it joins the Celebes Sea, while to the south it meets the Java Sea.The Mahakam River of Borneo empties into the strait.Ports along the strait include Balikpapan in Borneo, and Makassar and Palu in Sulawesi. The city of Samarinda is 48 km (30 mi) from the strait, along the Mahakam.The strait is a common shipping route for oceangoing ships too big to fit through the Straits of Malacca.The International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) defines the Makassar Strait as being one of the waters of the East Indian Archipelago. The IHO defines its limits as follows:The channel between the East coast of Borneo and the West coast of Celebes &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;Sulawesi&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, is bounded:"On the North." By a line joining Tanjong Mangkalihat, Borneo () and Stroomen Kaap (Cape Rivers), Celebes ()."On the South." By a line from the Southwestern extreme of Celebes (), through the Southern point of Tana Keke, to the Southern extreme of Laoet () thence up the West coast of that island to Tanjong Kiwi and thence across to Tanjong Petang, Borneo () at the Southern end of Laoet Strait.

  <page name="Pen-y-ghent">Pen-y-ghent or Penyghent is a fell in the Yorkshire Dales. It is one of the Yorkshire Three Peaks, the other two being Ingleborough and Whernside. It lies east of Horton in Ribblesdale. The Pennine Way links the summit to the village; the route is around in length as the Way curves initially to the north before turning east to reach the summit.The more direct route that traverses the southern 'nose' of the hill is the route usually taken by those attempting the Yorkshire Three Peaks Challenge, as the walk is usually (but not exclusively) done in an anti-clockwise direction starting and finishing in Horton in Ribblesdale. The other main hillwalking route on the hill heads north from the summit to reach Plover Hill before descending to join the bridleway that is Foxup Road.In the Cumbric language, exactly as in today's Welsh, "Pen" meant 'top' or 'head', and "y" is most likely the definite article ("the"), exactly as in Modern Welsh "y". These elements are common in placenames throughout the island, and especially in Wales (compare Penyberth 'end of the hedge/copse', or Penyffordd 'head of the road/way', etc.). The element "ghent" is more obscure, however: it could be taken to be 'edge' or 'border'. The name "Pen-y-ghent" could therefore mean 'Hill on the border' (compare Kent). Alternatively, "ghent" could mean 'wind' or 'winds' – from the closest Welsh transliteration, "gwynt" ('wind'). Thus it might mean simply 'Head of the Winds'. It is also possible that "ghent" may have been a tribal name and that the hill may have once been an important tribal centre. It is also acceptable to write the name as "Pen y Ghent" rather than "Pen-y-ghent".

  <page name="North Nibley">North Nibley is a village in Gloucestershire, England about northwest of Wotton-under-Edge.The village is commonly known as "Nibley", but the official name distinguishes it from the village of Nibley, just outside Yate, about away in South Gloucestershire. Nibley Green is an associated hamlet to its northwest at .The village is the probable birthplace of William Tyndale, who was responsible for translating the New Testament into English, for which he was later sentenced to death and burned at the stake in Vilvoorde, Flanders. Nibley House, next to the church, was the home of John Smyth (1567–1641), steward of Berkeley Castle and the Berkeley family estates, author of "Lives of the Berkeleys" and historian of the early settlement of Virginia.Nearby Stinchcombe Hill has become popular with walkers and horse riders, and is crossed by the Cotswold Way. The Tyndale Monument stands on Nibley Knoll just above the village, at on the Cotswold Way. From 1992, volunteers have cleared the area to recreate the previously open panoramic views of both the Severn Bridges and beyond to the Black Mountains in Wales.The village shop on Barrs Lane has been a run as a voluntary organisation by villagers since 2001. Since 2007 the villagers have organised the annual Nibley Music Festival. The village is home to the Nibley Nobblers football team and Nibley Cricket Team, who have won the legendary Pratt Cup two seasons in a row.In 2014 the final episode of the third series of BBC One's "Sherlock" featured the futuristic Swinhay House, home of Renishaw plc founder Sir David McMurtry, designed by eco-architect David Austin.

  <page name="Dunsinane Hill">Dunsinane Hill ( ) is near the village of Collace in Perthshire, Scotland. It is mentioned in Shakespeare's play "Macbeth". ""Macbeth shall never vanquished be, until Great Birnam wood to high Dunsinane hill Shall come against him"."It has the remains of two early forts. This is believed to be the site of a battle where Malcolm Canmore defeated Macbeth in 1054. In reality this was only a limited defeat for Macbeth. He was finally beaten and killed by Malcolm Canmore in 1057, at Lumphannan near Aberdeen.The pronunciation called for in Shakespeare's play has the accent on the first or third syllable, with a long 'a' (i.e. or ). However the correct pronunciation has the accent on the second syllable, with a short 'a'. The correct spelling of the name is Dunsinnan, Gaelic meaning ""The hill of ants.""; possibly a reference to the large number of people it took to build the fortress.The best access to Dunsinane Hill is from the rear of the Perthshire village of Collace on the Northern side of Dunsinane Hill, between the village and the quarry. There is a small parking area there suitable for 4 or 5 cars from which a clearly defined path leads directly to the summit.The impressive ramparts are still very obvious, though the interior was much disturbed in the 19th century by antiquarians attracted to the site by its Shakespearean connection. Little of value was learned about the history of the monument from these unscientific excavations.

  <page name="Wheaton station">Wheaton is a Washington Metro station in Montgomery County, Maryland (USA) on the Red Line.The station serves the suburb of Wheaton, and is located at the intersection of Georgia Avenue (Maryland Route 97) and Reedie Drive. This station features the longest set of single-span escalators in the Western Hemisphere, each featuring a length of , with a vertical rise of . It is the second deepest station in the system, behind Forest Glen, which has an elevator-only exit due to its depth. Wheaton's escalators travel at a speed of per minute (±5%) and are set at an inclination of 30 degrees. The trip takes approximately 2 minutes and 45 seconds, though some commuters shorten the time by walking.Another architectural feature of this station is separate tunnels and platforms for each direction, instead of the large, vaulted common room seen at most other underground stations in the Metro system. This design, which is similar to many of the London Underground's tube stations, was used to save money due to the station's depth. Forest Glen is the only other Washington Metro station to have this design.Service at Wheaton began on . It was the northeastern end of the Red Line for nearly eight years, until the Glenmont station opened in July 1998.

  <page name="Andagoya">Andagoya is a village in west-central Colombia. Andagoya is named for Pascual de Andagoya (1495–1548), a Spanish conquistador.The annual range of monthly mean temperatures – that is to say, the difference between the warmest and coldest months – at Andagoya is mere 0.7 °C (approximately 1.3 °F) as April, the warmest month, has an average temperature of 27.7 °C (81.9 °F) while November, the "coldest" month, averages 27.0 °C (80.6 °F); the average annual temperature is 27.4 °C (81.3 °F). This near complete uniformity of temperature is caused by the fact that Andagoya, at a latitude of 5° 5' North, lies extremely close to the thermal equator, which is situated a few degrees north of the astronomical equator because the Earth reaches perihelion (its closest position to the Sun in its orbit) in early January and is at aphelion (furthest away) in early July, causing places located precisely at the equator to receive somewhat more insolation (i.e., light and heat energy from the sun) in January than in July even though the height of the sun and the length of days would be the same at both times. At a few degrees north latitude, however, the perihelion/aphelion factor and the slightly higher sun and longer days experienced at the time of the summer solstice for the Northern Hemisphere cancel each other out, making the level of insolation experienced there virtually identical throughout the year.Every month of the year has at least 500 millimeters (19.7 inches) of average precipitation (December being the "driest" month), with the wettest month (May) averaging 650 millimeters (25.6 inches). Average annual precipitation is 6,817 millimeters (268.4 inches), and more rain falls at night than during the day, the reverse of what is true in most places that have tropical rain forest climates.

  <page name="CityPoint">CityPoint (previously known as Britannic House and Britannic Tower) is a skyscraper located on Ropemaker Street on the northern fringe of the City of London, the main financial district and historic nucleus of London.Originally named Britannic House, CityPoint was built in 1967 as a 35-storey, tall headquarters for British Petroleum (now BP), becoming the first building in the City of London area to exceed the height of St Paul's Cathedral. The designers were F. Milton Cashmore and H. N. W. Grosvenor. In 1991 British Petroleum moved back to their original headquarters on Finsbury Circus and the building was renamed Britannic Tower.It was refurbished in 2000, with additional floor space and the height increased to . The designer for the refurbishment was Sheppard Robson. It was renamed CityPoint after its refurbishment.CityPoint is the seventh-tallest building in the City, after the Heron Tower, 122 Leadenhall Street, Tower 42, 30 St Mary Axe, Broadgate Tower and 20 Fenchurch Street but only the 23rd-tallest in Greater London.In August 2005 its owner, Pillar Properties, sold the building for more than £500 million in one of the largest deals ever seen in the City office market.In early 2007 the building was again put on the market, this time for £650 million, and purchased by a private American company called Beacon Capital Partners. At the time it was the most expensive building sale in the United Kingdom. However 8 Canada Square at Canary Wharf eclipsed this by some margin just a few months later when it was sold for over £1 billion.A number of other large buildings are planned on sites nearby. These include a 43-storey, residential tower at Milton Court. A office tower at Ropemaker Place has also been developed by British Land.

The station is situated on the Isle of Dogs within the East End of London. It is between Mudchute and South Quay stations and is in Travelcard Zone 2.The Docklands Light Railway station opened as "Crossharbour" on 31 August 1987, and was renamed in 1994 to "Crossharbour and London Arena". Now that the neighbouring London Arena has been demolished the original name has been reinstated. The name "Crossharbour" refers to the nearby Glengall Bridge across Millwall Inner Dock.There are two platforms at the station with a reversing siding between the two running tracks just to the south of the station, and some trains (mainly from Stratford DLR station) used to terminate here as Lewisham DLR station was unable to handle too many trains. Nowadays however, it is rare to see trains terminate at Crossharbour, as many trains from Stratford now terminate at Canary Wharf DLR station.The St John's Estate is social housing estate adjacent to the DLR station.London Buses routes 135, 277 and the "D" prefix routes D6, and D8 serve the station; additionally 277 has a 24 hour service.

  <page name="Island Gardens DLR station">Island Gardens is a Docklands Light Railway (DLR) station near Island Gardens in North Greenwich in Greater London, England just north of the River Thames on the Isle of Dogs.The station is close to the southern tip of the Isle of Dogs and the River Thames. Island Gardens is a public park with a notable view across the river to the classical buildings of the former Greenwich Hospital and the National Maritime Museum, with Greenwich Park forming a backdrop. The northern entrance of the Greenwich foot tunnel is within the park.The original Island Gardens DLR station was opened on 31 August 1987 as the southern terminus of the initial system. It was built adjacent to the site of the old North Greenwich railway station, the southern terminus of the Millwall Extension Railway. It was elevated with two platforms, each capable of accommodating a single car train. The station required significant rebuilding to allow the platforms to take two-car trains.The extension to Lewisham passes under the River Thames in a deep tube tunnel. This required a new station to be built slightly further away from the river, north of Manchester Road, and underground. The original station and the southern end of the connecting viaduct have since been demolished.London Buses routes 135 and the "D" prefix route D7 and night route N550 serve the station.

  <page name="Alsatia">Alsatia in London, was the name given to an area lying north of the River Thames covered by the Whitefriars monastery, to the south of the west end of Fleet Street and adjacent to the Temple. Between the fifteenth and seventeenth centuries it had the privilege of a sanctuary, except against a writ of the Lord Chief Justice or of the Lords of the Privy Council; and as a result it was the refuge of the perpetrators of every grade of crime, debauchery, and offence against the laws. The execution of a warrant there, if at any time practicable, was attended with great danger, as all united in a maintenance in common of the immunity of the place. It was one of the last places of sanctuary used in England, abolished by Act of Parliament named "The Escape from Prison Act" in 1697 and a further Act in 1723. Eleven other places in London were named in the Acts (The Minories, The Mint, Salisbury Court, Whitefriars, Fulwoods Rents, Mitre Court, Baldwins Gardens, The Savoy, The Clink, Deadmans Place, Montague Close, and Stepney).Alsatia was named after the ancient name for Alsace, Europe, which was itself outside legislative and juridical lines, and, therefore, they were literally places without law. The name is thought to be a cant term for the area and is first known in print in the title of "The Squire of Alsatia", a 1688 play written by Thomas Shadwell.As of 2007, the word is still in use among the English and Australian judiciaries with the meaning of a place where the law cannot reach:Michael Moorcock's 2015 novel The Whispering Swarm is set in Alsatia.

In 2000, the college moved into the historic Federal Building in downtown Everett, spending $2 million to renovate the 1917-built office building. Off-campus classes were also held at a Boeing facility in the south Puget Sound (about 30 miles from Everett) to accommodate students living in that area. Limited classes continued to be offered at the Boeing facility even after the main campus moved to Everett. The institution closed on September 1, 2006, due to a decline in enrollment and substantial defect.

  <page name="Tarana">Tarana or Taranah (, ) is a type of composition in Hindustani classical vocal music in which certain words and syllables (e.g. "odani", "todani", "tadeem" and "yalali") based on Persian and Arabic phonemes are rendered at a medium ("madhya") or fast ("drut") pace ("laya"). It was invented by Amir Khusro (1253-1325 CE), and is similar to the Qalbana form of Sufi poetry. In modern times the tarana is most commonly associated with the singer Amir Khan, who helped popularize it and researched its origins and the syllables used. Tarana was also used by Sikh tenth Guru Sri Guru Gobind Singh in his compositions like "jagardang nagardang bagardang".The structure consists of a main melody, usually short, repeated many times, with variation and elaboration at the performer's discretion. There is a second, contrasting melody, usually with higher notes, which is introduced once before returning to the main melody. The tarana may include a Persian couplet, and may use syllables from sitar or tabla such as "dar-dar" or "dir-dir"; singers might recite full compositions (e.g. tihais, gats, tukdas) within the body of the tarana.In the words of Thakur Jaidev Singh, an influential commentator on Indian music:The "thillana" from Carnatic music is based on the tarana, according to Balasaraswati, and is widely used in dance performances.

Seal Cove is a bay in East Falkland directly to the west of the island.Alexander Jaffray is the current owner.Lively Island has an area of . Its highest point is . There are several streams and ponds, the largest of which is Enderby Pond, , an important waterfowl site. Lively is rat-free but with a century and a half of grazing little tussoc remains and there are many large patches of eroded ground.Lively Island is surrounded by other, smaller islands and islets in the Lively Island group. Some of these Islets are linked to Lively Island by sandbars. North East Island which is just off the coast of Lively, was the site of a rat eradication programme in 2003. (The rest of the Lively islands are rat free.)The Lively Island group has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA). Birds for which the site is of conservation significance include Falkland steamer ducks, ruddy-headed geese, gentoo penguins (650 breeding pairs), Magellanic penguins, southern giant petrels (40 pairs), white-bridled finches, blackish cinclodes and Cobb's wrens.

  <page name="Jugra">Jugra is a mukim, historical town and former royal town in Kuala Langat District, Selangor, Malaysia.Jugra was the royal capital of Selangor when the then ruling monarch, Sultan Abdul Samad built Istana Jugra (Jugra Palace) and moved there in 1875. It was situated in a strategic location, not exactly at the river mouth but easily accessible from the Straits of Malacca, and protected by a hill, Bukit Jugra; which stands clearly out above the low-lying mangrove swamps. For centuries it served as a familiar landmark to navigators of the Straits of Malacca. Chinese, Arab and European mariners marked it in their charts; Bukit Jugra was also known to many foreign navigators as Parcelar Hill, derived from the Arabic name for it, "balasar".It was during this time that Jugra also briefly became the centre of British administration in Selangor, although this was soon moved to Klang, and a decade later to Kuala Lumpur. The Sultan continued to live at Jugra until he died in 1898, and the new Sultan, Sultan Alauddin Sulaiman Shah also known as Sultan Sulaiman was proclaimed there. This was the last important occasion in Jugra. Sultan Alauddin Sulaiman built the Istana Bandar in 1905 where he lived in for the next 35 years.After that, Jugra quickly shrank to become a backwater, as even the local administration was shifted to the new centre of Banting and Sultan Sulaiman made his official residence at Klang.Among places of interest in this quaint town are royal palaces such as Istana Bandar, Makam Sultan Abdul Samad, a royal mausoleum, and mosques such as Masjid Alaeddin. The nearby Bukit Jugra is used for paragliding.

  <page name="Mount Kōya">First settled in 819 by the monk Kūkai, Mt. Kōya is primarily known as the world headquarters of the Kōyasan Shingon sect of Japanese Buddhism. Located in an 800 m high valley amid the eight peaks of the mountain (which was the reason this location was selected, in that the terrain is supposed to resemble a lotus plant), the original monastery has grown into the town of Kōya, featuring a university dedicated to religious studies and 120 temples, many of which offer lodging to pilgrims. The mountain is home to the following famous sites:In 2004, UNESCO designated Mt. Kōya, along with two other locations on the Kii Peninsula, Yoshino and Omine; and Kumano Sanzan, as World Heritage Sites "Sacred Sites and Pilgrimage Routes in the Kii Mountain Range".The complex includes a memorial hall and cemetery honoring Japanese who were imprisoned or executed for committing atrocities during World War II.Koya-san is accessible primarily by the Nankai Electric Railway from Namba Station (in Osaka) to Gokurakubashi Station at the base of the mountain. A cable car from Gokurakubashi then whisks visitors to the top in 5 minutes. The entire trip takes about 1.5 hours on an express train or 2 hours by non-express.Local automobile traffic can be very heavy on weekends until well into the evening. On weekdays, however, the mountain offers a pleasant drive followed by the excitement upon reaching the monasteries lining the summit. Many Buddhist monasteries on the mountain function as hotels for visitors providing traditional accommodation with an evening meal and breakfast.

The battle commenced after a British fleet, returning from delivering supplies to Fort Ontario, was ambushed by a party of French and Indians. Although outnumbered, British and Colonial forces were able repulse several attacks by using the island as a stronghold. The island identified on maps as "Battle Island" was created during the excavation of an adjacent canal; the battle actually took place on a smaller island just to the south.Battle Island State Park occupies land originally owned by Frederick A. Emerick, who deeded of the park's property to the state in 1916. When the remainder of his property was turned over to the state in 1938, the land was officially designated as a state park.One of the park's main attractions is its 18-hole, par 72 golf course, designed by Devereux Emmett. The course length is from its longest tees.The park also offers trails for cross-country skiing and a food concession.

  <page name="Telemax">The Telemax is a telecommunication tower built from 1988 to 1992 in Hanover. The tower was designed by Hans U. Boeckler and is 272 metres (892 feet) high. The tower stands on a 10 metre high base building, which brings its overall height to 282 metres (925 feet). Owner and operator of the site is Deutsche Funkturm (DFMG), a subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom.There is no observation deck on the Telemax. The building is of architectural interest due to its square surfaces. In 1997, Boeckler received cement-steel prize "Die Kunst des Bewehrens" for the tower's truss structure.Originally a substantially slimmer round tower was planned. However, when the plans were submitted for approval, the inscription Model Hamburg was allegedly still written on the plan. It was decided that only a Model Hanover was appropriate for the state capital and thus the planning of the telecommunication tower had to begin again.The Telemax is in city's Buchholz-Kleefeld district, which is about 8 km (5 mi) from the city center. It can be seen from all over this part of the city, and is an obvious landmark. It can be seen from the highway from about 20 km (12.5 mi) away, from the A 2 near Lehrte, for example. The name of the previous radio tower in the city was changed to VW-Tower after this new tower went into service. The tower is illuminated in magenta, the corporate color of Deutsche Telekom AG, for special occasions, such as the Hannover Messe or CeBit.

It is the westernmost point in Wales other than the isolated rocks on which the Smalls Lighthouse stands, and is known for its huge colony of northern gannets. Grassholm has been owned since 1947 by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, and is one of its oldest reserves. It reaches .Grassholm National Nature Reserve is the third most important site for gannets in the world, after two sites in Scotland; St Kilda and Bass Rock. It serves as a breeding site for 39,000 pairs of the birds, and supports around 10 percent of the world population. The turbulent sea around Grassholm also provides good feeding ground for porpoises and bottlenose dolphins.Boats sail to Grassholm from St Davids Lifeboat Station and Martin's Haven on the mainland.Geologically, the island is largely formed from keratophyre though the northwest coast and islet of West Tump are formed from basalt. A couple of NE-SW aligned faults cross the island. Raised beaches are present in places.Grassholm has been identified with "Gwales", an island featured in the "Mabinogion". In the Second Branch of the Mabinogi, Gwales is the site of a fabulous castle where the severed head of Brân the Blessed is kept miraculously alive for eighty years while his companions feast in blissful forgetfulness.On 15 July 1945, the cargo ship ran aground on Grassholm and sank.

About long, it opens onto the Firth of Lorne at its southwestern end. The part of the loch upstream of Corran is long and an average of about wide. The southern part of the loch is wider, and its branch southeast of the island of Lismore is known as the Lynn of Lorne. Loch Eil feeds into Loch Linnhe at the latter's northernmost point, while from the east Loch Leven feeds in the loch just downstream of Corran and Loch Creran feeds into the Lynn of Lorne.

  <page name="Gibeah">Gibeah (; "Giv'a") is a place name appearing in several books of the Bible. It is generally identified with a hill in Jerusalem, on the outskirts of the Pisgat Ze'ev and Shuafat neighborhoods, known as Tell el-Ful. However, this identification was challenged by Israel Finkelstein in 2011.Gibeah may be a variation of the Hebrew word meaning “hill,” other names include Gibeah of God () Gibeah of Benjamin () for it is in the territory of the Tribe of Benjamin and Gibeah of Saul () where the biblical King Saul lived.Gibeah is believed to be located along the Central Benjamin Plateau, north of Jerusalem along the Watershed Ridge at above sea level.The site was first excavated in 1868 by Charles Warren, while C.R. Conder described the remains in 1874. William F. Albright led his first excavation from 1922 to 1923, and returned for a second season in 1923. His work was published in 1960. P.W. Lapp conducted a six-week salvage excavation in 1964. According to Kenneth Kitchen "Upon this strategic point was found an Iron I occupation replaced (at an interval) by a fortress ("I"), subsequently refurbished ("II"), and then later in disuse. The oldest level may reflect the Gibeah of Judg 19-20. The excavations by Albright, checked by Lapp, would favor the view that it was Saul who built the first fortress, later repaired by him or David. the first fort (quadrangular) had at least one rectangular corner-tower at its southwest angle; it may have had others at the other corners, but no traces were detected."

  <page name="Cleveland Dam">The Cleveland Dam is a concrete dam at the head of the Capilano River in North Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada that holds back Capilano Lake, also known as Capilano reservoir. Part of the Capilano River Regional Park, it is not used for generating hydroelectricity, but rather for storing a portion of the Lower Mainland's drinking water. Construction was started in 1951 and completed in 1954.The dam is named after engineer Ernest Albert Cleveland who envisioned the need for the proper maintenance of a pristine and efficient water supply as well as sustainable use of water resources. He served as the first chief commissioner of the Greater Vancouver Water District from 1926 until his death in 1952.The dam is prominently featured in the "Smallville" episode "Leech," where Clark Kent loses his powers via a lightning strike while attempting to save a classmate from jumping from the dam, as well as in the episode "Dichotic" in the second season. It is also featured in the second season episode of the series "Supernatural", titled "Simon Said". A Cadillac goes over the dam into the Capilano River in the film "The 6th Day".

The village population at the 2011 census was 780.It is home to the nearby Oldbury nuclear power station, a Magnox power station which opened in 1967 and ceased operation on 29 February 2012.The area has been considered for nuclear 'new build' totalling some 3000MWe of capacity – either two or three PWRs. This would be more than the river flow could provide cooling for and so natural-draught cooling towers with a possible height of 200m have been postulated as necessary (- the existing station is 54m high).Village attractions include a footpath near the river, a pub known as the "Anchor Inn" plus the village hall and two churches. It is also the home of Thornbury Sailing Club.The parish church is dedicated to St Arilda, a local saint and martyr whose origins may lie in the fourth or fifth century.

  <page name="River Nith">The River Nith (; ) is a river in South West Scotland.The Nith rises in the Carsphairn hills of East Ayrshire, more precisely between Prickeny Hill and Enoch Hill, 7 km east of Dalmellington. For the majority of its course it flows in a generally southern direction through Dumfries and Galloway, before spilling into the Solway Firth at Ards point.The territory through which the river flows is called Nithsdale (historically known as "Stranit" from , "valley of the Nith").For estuaries the principle followed is that the river should be visible at all times. The measurement therefore follows the centre of the river at low tide and the mouth of the river is assumed to be at the coastal high tide mark. In Scotland this does not generally make a significant difference, except for rivers draining into shallow sloping sands of the Irish Sea and Solway Firth, notably the Nith. At low tide, the sea recedes to such an extent that the length of the Nith is extended by 13 km to 113.8 km (70.7 miles), making it Scotland's seventh longest river.The estuary of the River Nith is an important site for wildfowl, and is protected at an international level as part of the Upper Solway Flats and Marshes Ramsar site and Special Protection Area, and as part of the Solway Firth Special Area of Conservation. At a national level, the area is a Site of Special Scientific Interest and is within the Caerlaverock National Nature Reserve.The Nith Estuary National Scenic Area recognises the scenic value of the area.Upstream to Downstream:

It was greatly expanded in 1824 by the architect William Burn who turned it into a large mansion house in the Scots Baronial style.The Brodie family called the castle home until the late 20th century. It's widely accepted that the Brodies have been associated with the land the castle is built on since around 1160, when it is believed that King Malcolm IV gave the land to the family.Ninian Brodie of Brodie (The Brodie of Brodie) died in 2003, and his son shortly after. Unfortunately, as his family had been unhappy with the transfer of the castle to the National Trust for Scotland, no Brodie now lives in the castle. The former family wing is being prepared for holiday letting.Architecturally, the castle has a very well preserved central keep with two 5-storey towers on opposing corners. As with many fortified stately homes of the time it has no wall. It does, however, contain a guardroom and secret passages to help the occupants escape assassination attempts.

  <page name="Toms River">The Toms River, formerly "Tom's River," is a freshwater river and estuary in Ocean County, New Jersey in the United States.The Toms River rises in the Pine Barrens of northern Ocean County and flows southeast and east, fed by several branches, in a meandering course through wetland area and empties into Barnegat Bay, an inlet of the Atlantic Ocean. The lower 5 mi (8 km) of the river is a broad tidal estuary navigable within the community of Toms River. The lowest reaches of the river provide convenient locations for marinas and yacht clubs and excellent points from which to go fishing and crabbing. Canoeing and kayaking are also popular pursuits on the Toms. The river can be paddled for from Don Connor Boulevard below Route 528 all the way to Barnegat Bay.In the 1960s, the lower river was found to have been polluted for many years from the open discharge of waste from a Ciba Geigy dye manufacturing plant. This was considered to have been the cause of a cancer cluster of leukaemia in the Toms River township that led to multimillion-dollar compensation payments to the families involved. There is a 'great deal of uncertainty' as to whether the pollution was a causal factor in the cancer cluster. A 2014 Pulitzer Prize winning book, "," examined the issue in detail. Recent public-private coalitions to restore the river and to purchase and preserve the wetland areas near its source in the Pinelands have resulted in an increase in water quality.The Toms River was known as "Goose Creek" until it was renamed in the early 18th century either for English captain William Toms, farmer and ferryman Thomas Luker, or a Native American named Tom. The settlement that was founded in 1712 along the river subsequently took the name as well.

  <page name="Ellsworth Mountains">The Ellsworth Mountains are the highest mountain ranges in Antarctica, forming a long and wide chain of mountains in a north to south configuration on the western margin of the Ronne Ice Shelf in Marie Byrd Land. They are bisected by Minnesota Glacier to form the northern Sentinel Range and the southern Heritage Range. The former is by far the higher and more spectacular with Vinson Massif (4,892 m) constituting the highest point on the continent.The mountains were discovered on November 23, 1935, by Lincoln Ellsworth in the course of a trans-Antarctic flight from Dundee Island to the Ross Ice Shelf. He gave the descriptive name Sentinel Range.The mountains were mapped in detail by the U.S. Geological Survey from ground surveys and U.S. Navy aerial photography, 1958-66. When it became evident that the mountains comprise two distinct ranges, the US-ACAN restricted the application of Sentinel Range to the high northern one and gave the name Heritage Range to the southern one; the Committee recommended the name of the discoverer for this entire group of mountains.The temperatures in the Ellsworth Mountains average around -30 °C (-20 °F). The best time for expeditions are November through January, mid-summer in the Southern Hemisphere. However, arranging an outing here is a difficult task, requiring either official scientific sponsorship or considerable financial resources.

  <page name="Willimantic River">The Willimantic River is a tributary of the Shetucket River, approximately 25 mi (40 km) long in northeastern Connecticut in the New England region of the United States.It is formed in northern Tolland County, near Stafford Springs by the confluence of Middle River and Furnace Brook. It flows south to the city of Willimantic, where it joins the Natchaug River to form the Shetucket. Along the way, it is joined by Roaring Brook, Bone Mill Brook, Eagleville Brook, Cedar Swamp Brook, Mill Brook in Coventry, Skungamaug River, Hop River, and Ten Mile River. It feeds and drains from Eagleville Pond.Shortly upstream from its confluence with the Natchaug, the Willimantic experiences a drop of ninety feet in one mile. This section was named "Wilimentuck" (land of swiftly moving waters) by the Native Americans who fished there. The river powered textile mills from Stafford Springs to Willimantic, including the American Thread Company mill. None of these mills are operating as of 2007, having all been destroyed or converted to other uses such as apartment space.A popular long paddling route begins south of Stafford Springs along Route 32 where the river is mostly quickwater all of the way to the flatwater of Eagleville Pond. The remainder is fairly easy going to the take-out at Route 66. Beware of the dam at the Route 275 bridge. Other access points may be at the N. River Road bridge, the Route 74 bridge, the Depot Rd bridge, the Route 195 bridge, the Jones Crossing bridge, the Merrow Road bridge, the U.S. Route 44 bridge, Brigham bridge, near the Route 275 dam, the Depot Rd bridge, the Route 31 bridge, and the Flanders Rd bridge.

  <page name="Shetucket River">The Shetucket River is a tributary of the Thames River, long, in eastern Connecticut in the United States.It is formed at Willimantic by the junction of the Willimantic and Natchaug rivers. It flows southeast and south. Approximately northeast of Norwich it receives the Quinebaug River and broadens into a wide estuary which stretches southeast for approximately and joins the Thames estuary on the south side of Norwich.The river flows through an especially unspoiled rural section of southern New England, despite the historical prevalence of industry in the surrounding region. Parts of the rivers have been designated by the federal government as the Quinebaug and Shetucket Rivers Valley National Heritage Corridor. The National Park Service describes the river valley as the "last green valley" in the Boston-to-Washington megalopolis. In nighttime satellite photos, the valley appears distinctively dark amidst the lights of the surrounding urban and suburban regions.The entire length of the river, as well as the lower part of the Natchaug River flowing into it, is a popular recreational paddling route.Canoe/Kayak launch sites are located at the following locations:Short, marked portages are required at four hydroelectric dams: Scotland Dam, Occum Dam, Taftville Dam, and Greenville Dam.

  <page name="Mount Lucania">Mount Lucania is the third highest mountain located entirely in Canada. A long ridge connects Mount Lucania with Mount Steele (5,073m), the fifth highest in Canada. Lucania was named by the Duke of Abruzzi, as he stood on the summit of Mount Saint Elias on July 31, 1897, having just completed the first ascent. Seeing Lucania in the far distance, beyond Mount Logan, he immediately named it "after the ship on which the expedition had sailed from Liverpool to New York," the RMS Lucania.The first ascent of Mount Lucania was made in 1937 by Bradford Washburn and Robert Hicks Bates. They used an airplane to reach Walsh Glacier, above sea level; the use of air support for mountaineering was novel at the time. Washburn called upon Bob Reeve, a famous Alaskan bush pilot, who later replied by cable to Washburn, "Anywhere you'll ride, I'll fly". The ski-equipped Fairchild F-51 made several trips to the landing site on the glacier without event in May, but on landing with Washburn and Bates in June, the plane sank into unseasonal slush. Washburn, Bates and Reeve pressed hard for five days to get the airplane out and Reeve was eventually able to get the airplane airborne with all excess weight removed and with the assistance of a smooth icefall with a steep drop. Washburn and Bates continued on foot to make the first ascent of Lucania, and in an epic descent and journey to civilization, they hiked over through the wilderness to safety in the small town of Burwash Landing in the Yukon.The second ascent of Lucania was made in 1967 by Jerry Halpern, Mike Humphreys, Gary Lukis, and Gerry Roach.David Roberts, "Escape from Lucania: An Epic Story of Survival" (2002), Simon &amp; Schuster, ISBN 0-7432-2432-9.

Steele stands at .It was named after Sir Sam Steele, the North-West Mounted Police officer in charge of the force in the Yukon during the Klondike Gold Rush.Walter A. Wood led a team consisting of Foresta Wood (Walter's wife), Swiss guide Hans Fuhrer, Joseph W. Fobes, Harrison Wood and I. Pearce Hazard. The expedition approached the peak on the eastern side from Kluane Lake. Base camp was established at the foot of the Steele Glacier with horses carrying loads to Advance Base Camp (known as Camp 6) further along the glacier. ABC provided good views of the mountain and the team decided on the east ridge as their line of ascent.After waiting for the weather to improve after heavy snowfalls, a four-man team consisting of Walter Wood, Harrison Wood, Fuhrer and Forbes left Camp 8 at the base of the ridge. Their plan to was to make a push to the summit. After steady upwards progress, deteriorating weather forced them to return to Camp 8 where they waited out a five-day storm which dumped over a metre of fresh snow. They started out again on August 15 and the ascent was made easier this time by windblown and hard steep snow slopes rather than steep soft snow on their earlier attempt. At , a plateau of wretched snow forced the team to crawl on all fours. Walter Wood commented:Alternating the lead every 100 paces, they made their way from the plateau to the top, finally reaching the summit at 2:30 pm. The team enjoyed a blissful thirty minutes of windless conditions on top before beginning their descent.

One of the country's longest rivers, it flows for from Lake Rotoiti through the Buller Gorge and into the Tasman Sea near the town of Westport. As Rotoiti itself is fed by the Travers River it can be claimed that the Buller's source is at the headwaters of the Travers, on the northern slopes of Mount Travers in the Saint Arnaud Range. The Paparoa Range separates the Buller River from the Grey River. A number of flora and fauna are found in the Buller watershed, many of these extending onto the slopes of the Paparoa Range.The Maori name for the Buller, "Kawatiri", is rarely used.The Buller River upstream from Murchison along with the Mangles River are popular for whitewater kayaking and recreational fishing. State Highway 6 follows the river for much of its length.This river has an annual mean flow of and boasts the highest flood flow of any New Zealand river which is over .The Buller has several major tributaries. These include (in order from Lake Rotoiti) the Gowan River, the Matakitaki River, the Maruia River, and the Inangahua River. Other smaller tributaries include the Hope, Owen, Mangles, Matiri, Blackwater, and Ohikanui Rivers.In July 2001 the Buller Water Conservation Order came into force, listing the waters of the Buller River and tributaries that are to be retained in their natural state or protected because of the outstanding characteristics, features and values of the waters.The river is named after Charles Buller, Member of Parliament and director of the New Zealand Company.

  <page name="Connoquenessing Creek">Connoquenessing Creek is a tributary of the Beaver River, approximately 50 mi (80 km) long, in Western Pennsylvania in the United States.It rises in eastern Butler County and flows southwest, through the Lake Oneida reservoir and past Butler, then WNW in a meandering course past Eidenau where Breakneck Creek is received, and then continuing past Harmony and Zelienople. It receives Slippery Rock Creek from the northwest near Ellwood City, then joins the Beaver west of Ellwood City, approximately 3 mi (5 km) further downstream.In 2000, a scientific study was conducted to determine the health of the creek. Researchers discovered that only the Mississippi River received more toxic materials than the Connoquenessing, making the small river the second most polluted waterway in the United States. "The Armco Inc. steel facility in Butler, purchased last September [1999] by AK Steel, ranked first nationally for the amount of pollutant discharges. The steelmaker legally discharged more than 29 million pounds of nitrate compounds -- a waste produced when nitric acid is used to "pickle" or clean the surface of raw steel—into Connoquenessing Creek."However, as of 2010, the Connoquenessing Creek was not listed in the national Top 10 for polluted waterways. Also, as of 2010, Armco Inc. steel in Butler was not listed in the Top 20 in regards to national pollutant dischargers.The creek is a popular canoeing and kayaking destination, with many boaters entering the creek at various locations.

  <page name="Haast Pass">Haast Pass is a mountain pass in the Southern Alps of the South Island of New Zealand. It is named for Julius von Haast, a 19th-century explorer who was also geologist for the Provincial government of Canterbury. The pass was used by Māori in pre-European times, but not on a regular basis.It is one of the three passes where a road crosses over the Southern Alps, the other two being Lewis Pass and Arthur's Pass, although the Homer Tunnel also passes under the Main Divide. The road through Haast Pass (State Highway 6) was converted from a rough track to a formed road in 1966. and finally received a complete tarmac surface by 1995. In the early 20th century, a railway from the West Coast through the pass to Otago was considered; it would have linked the Ross Branch with the Otago Central Railway, which then terminated in Omakau. However, the line never came to fruition; the Otago Central Railway terminated in Cromwell and no railway was built south of Ross, just a lightly laid bush tramway to serve logging interests near Lake Ianthe.The Haast Pass rises to a height of 562 metres above sea level at the saddle between the valleys of the Haast and Makarora Rivers. As such, it is the lowest of the passes traversing the Southern Alps. The Haast Pass road is devoid of any settlements between Haast and Makarora. The road passes through predominantly unmodified beech forest. The pass itself is within the limits of Mount Aspiring National Park and forms part of the boundary between Otago and the West Coast.

  <page name="Mataura River">The Mataura River is in the Southland Region of the South Island of New Zealand. It is long.The river's headwaters are located in the Eyre Mountains to the south of Lake Wakatipu. From there it flows southeast towards Gore, where it turns southward. It then passes through the town of Mataura, and enters the Pacific Ocean at Toetoes Bay on the southern coast of the South Island. Much of its channel is braided.The Mataura is renowned as a source of brown trout, and is a popular fishing venue. It has been identified as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International because it supports breeding colonies of the endangered black-billed gull.The Mataura, along with the three other main Southland rivers, the Waiau, Oreti and Aparima, breached during the Southland floods of January 1984. Commercial and residential areas of the town of Mataura were particularly affected, including the pulp and paper plant. Until about 18,000 years ago the Mataura drained Lake Wakatipu. The Kingston Flyer follows part of the former river bed, now blocked by glacial moraine.

The town in the Central Highlands Region local government area, north west of the state capital Brisbane and west of the regional city of Rockhampton.The site today is just a small group of houses on the Capricorn Highway, however, the township has its place in history.As the railway headed west from Rockhampton, a number of towns sprang up at the head of line. These towns were only intended to service the work of the crews laying the rails, but some have lasted over a century. Bogantungan was one of these. It became a town of some thousands of people, with around 30 hotels. After the line moved on, so did most of the town, to form the next settlement.Bogantungan Post Office opened on 8 July 1881 and closed in 1982.On 26 February 1960, Bogantungan became the site of one of Queensland's worst train disasters. The "Midlander" passenger train, heading east to Rockhampton, passed over the flooded Medway Creek, just west of the town. The bridge collapsed when the train was partly over, with a number of carriages dropping into the water. A total of 4 passengers and 3 crew were killed, with 43 injured.

  <page name="Barbeau Peak">Barbeau Peak is a mountain in Qikiqtaaluk, Nunavut, Canada. Located on Ellesmere Island within Quttinirpaaq National Park, it is the highest mountain in Nunavut and the Canadian Arctic. The mountain was named in 1969 for Dr. Marius Barbeau (1883-1969), a Canadian anthropologist whose research into First Nations and Inuit cultures gained him international acclaim.Barbeau Peak is characterized by deep and long crevasses, razor thin ridges and highly variable and volatile weather.Barbeau Peak is the highest mountain within the British Empire Range as well as the Arctic Cordillera, as well as in all of eastern North America.Barbeau Peak was first climbed on 7 June 1967 by British geologist/glaciologist Geoffrey Hattersley-Smith as part of a joint Defence Research Board/Royal Air Force field party. The party both named the peak and determined its height.The second ascent was by an eight-man American team in June 1982 (Errington,Trafton AAC 1983) via the north ridge. Subsequent ascents have been made in 1992, 1998, 2000 and 2002, though as of 2006 only seven successful summits have been attained.

It is one of the highlights of the Canadian portion of the International Appalachian Trail. It is also part of the eighth and final section of the Nepisguit Mi'Gmaq Trail. The mountain was named after Thomas Carleton, New Brunswick's first lieutenant governor, and forms part of the Notre Dame Mountains chain, which is visible on Map 24 of the NB Atlas.Before aerial surveillance was extensively used, a hut was maintained on the summit for fire-spotting in the remote north-central part of the province. A very similar hut was maintained on Big Bald Mountain. Triangulation among these huts and other fire towers allowed the locations of wildfires to be determined quickly and easily.Mount Carleton is a monadnock, an erosional remnant of resistant igneous rocks that remained after an ancient Mesozoic peneplain surface was uplifted in the Cenozoic to form a plateau, and subsequently dissected via millions of years of erosion by wind, water and glacial ice. It consists of 400 million-year-old rhyolitic and basaltic volcanics.

The valley through which the river flows is popular with trampers and is part of the Travers-Sabine tramping circuit, which follows a major portion of the river, starting from Kerr Bay at Saint Arnaud and, after crossing the Travers Saddle (1787 metres), descends the valley of the Sabine River.The river feeds into Lake Rotoiti. It is not a navigable waterway due to its small size and numerous rocky cascades. The lower reaches of the river lie in open tussock which was burnt and grazed by early European settlers. Further upstream the river flows through unmodified beech forest. The upper reaches are in subalpine scrub above the bushline.The New Zealand Department of Conservation maintains a number of mountain huts and shelters along the length of the Travers Valley and within the surrounding mountains. These include the Lake Head Hut, Coldwater Hut, the Angelus Hut, the Hopeless Hut, the Cupola Basin Hut, John Tait Hut, and the Upper Travers Hut.

  <page name="Mount Niblock">Mount Niblock is a mountain in Banff National Park near Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada.The mountain was named in 1904 after John Niblock, a superintendent with the Canadian Pacific Railway. Niblock was an early promoter of tourism in the Rockies and influenced the naming of some of the CPR stops in Western Canada.Mt. Niblock is a popular scramble in the Lake Louise area and is sometimes combined in the same day with Mount Whyte (), although the latter is a more difficult scramble. The best time for climbing Mt. Niblock is July through September when the normal route is usually free of snow. Attempting it in the spring or early summer may include significant avalanche hazard.To access Mt. Niblock, follow the trail as it begins near Chateau Lake Louise, passes Mirror Lake and then Lake Agnes. Follow the right hand shore line trail to the far end of the lake until it begins its left turn towards the Big Beehive. Here an obvious path can be found leading to the lower scree slopes and short cliffs. A more detailed route description can be found in "Scrambles in the Canadian Rockies".

The mountain can be seen from the Trans-Canada Highway, and offers views of the Valley of the Ten Peaks, including the Chateau Lake Louise.The mountain was named in 1898 by Sir William Methuen after William Whyte, a representative of the Canadian Pacific Railway.Mt. Whyte is usually combined with Mount Niblock () when done as a scramble. However, while Mt. Niblock is rated a moderate scramble, Mt. Whyte is much more difficult due to additional exposure and loose rock. The scramble should not be attempted in snowy conditions due to considerable fall distance which would likely prove fatal. A route description can be found in "Scrambles in the Canadian Rockies".For rock climbers, the Perren Route (II 5.6) is another option. While mostly a scramble as well, a short section of difficult climbing near the top in addition to route finding challenges and loose rock will not make it an easy ascent.

  <page name="Keck Graduate Institute">The Keck Graduate Institute (KGI) is a private research graduate school in Claremont, California. Founded in 1997, it is the seventh and newest member of the Claremont Consortium. It offers seven academic programs in a range of disciplines with foci both in the life sciences industry and in applied life science research.Academic programs at KGI are organized into two schools, the School of Applied Life Science (SALS) and the School of Pharmacy (SoP). In addition, KGI offers a selective four-year undergraduate program, the Minerva Schools at KGI, in partnership with the Minerva Project.The decision to establish Keck Graduate Institute as a seventh Claremont College met with some opposition, particularly from faculty of the other Claremont Colleges who objected to its lack of tenure, and environmentalists who opposed its plans to build a campus next to the Bernard Field Station, an area of undeveloped scrubland. The environmental issue was largely settled when KGI decided to establish its campus at a different location, and other opposition gradually faded.Keck Graduate Institute of Applied Life Sciences is accredited by the Accrediting Commission for Senior Colleges and Universities of the Western Association of Schools and Colleges. The School of Pharmacy has been granted Candidate status by the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE).KGI maintains four research centers:Ionian Technologies was founded in 2000, and was the first spin-off company to commercialize technology developed at KGI. Ionian focuses on molecular diagnostics for emerging and infectious diseases, and in 2004 was awarded a contract to develop a handheld biothreat detector using isothermal amplification of DNA.

The disease is spread between waterways through live or frozen bait fish, roe, contaminated fishing equipment or live water wells in boats.The U.S.S. Lady of the Lake is reportedly sunken in Conesus Lake.When frozen over in the winter, Conesus Lake is used for snowmobiling and ice fishing.On July 3 of each year, the residents of the lake participate in a tradition called the "Ring of Fire", sponsored by the Conesus Lake Association. Participants light road flares around the lake and shoot off fireworks. The festivities typically start at dusk, with approximately 10,000 flares lit at 10:00 PM.

It was called Mellenskov, but was renamed soon after its founding. The 2013 census recorded Eketahuna's population at 441; down from 456 in 2006.The town is located at the foot of the Tararua Ranges which lie to the west. It is 35 kilometres north of Masterton and a similar distance south of Palmerston North. It is situated on State Highway 2 and the eastern bank of the Makakahi River.Eketahuna is considered by some to be the stereotypical rural New Zealand town, and is occasionally used in conversation to represent "the real New Zealand". New Zealanders colloquially refer to the town of Eketahuna the way other English speakers refer to Timbuktu, i.e., the middle of nowhere, "the sticks", the end of the world. Likewise, Eketahuna is a booming metropolis compared to the mythical town of Waikikamukau (pronounced "Why-kick-a-moo-cow").The Mount Bruce bird sanctuary is located to the south of the town.The name of the town, when spoken, sounds like a sentence in Afrikaans which translates to "I have a rooster". This is a source of amusement to immigrant Afrikaans-speaking South Africans in New Zealand.On 20 January 2014, the town was the epicenter of the 2014 Eketahuna earthquake.

  <page name="Breithorn">The Breithorn (German for "broad horn"; 4,164 m) is a mountain range of the Pennine Alps with its highest peak of the same name (but also called "Breithorn (Western Summit)"), located on the border between Switzerland and Italy. It lies on the main chain of the Alps, approximately halfway between the Matterhorn and Monte Rosa and east of the Theodul Pass. Most of the massif is glaciated and includes several subsidiary peaks, all located east of the main summit: the Central Breithorn, the western Breithorn Twin (or Eastern Breithorn), the Gendarm (or eastern Breithorn Twin) and the Roccia Nera. The main summit is sometimes distinguished by the name "Western Breithorn" (, ). The nearest settlements are Zermatt (Valais) and St-Jacques (Aosta Valley).The Breithorn is considered the most easily climbed 4,000 m Alpine peak. This is due to the Klein Matterhorn cable car which takes climbers to over 3,820 m (12,700 ft) from Zermatt for a starting point. The standard route (SSW flank) is from the Italian side of the mountain (the south side) and continues over a glacial plateau before climbing to the summit on a 35 degree snow slope. However, inexperienced mountaineers may run into severe difficulty if caution is not taken near cornices or in bad weather. For experienced climbers wanting more of a challenge, the half traverse of the Breithorn crest is another option.The Breithorn was first climbed in 1813 by Henry Maynard (climber), Joseph-Marie Couttet, Jean Gras, Jean-Baptiste Erin and Jean-Jacques Erin.

  <page name="Valley of the Ten Peaks">Valley of the Ten Peaks () is a valley in Banff National Park in Alberta, Canada, which is crowned by ten notable peaks and also includes Moraine Lake. The valley can be reached by following the Moraine Lake road near Lake Louise. The ten peaks were originally named by Samuel Allen, an early explorer of the region, who simply referred to them by using the numerals from one to ten in the Stoney First Nations Language. He may have learned the terms from his Native American guides, who helped him with the horses. The Nakoda–also known as the Stoney Indians–is a tribe whose culture and dialect are closely related to that of the Assiniboine First Nation, from whom they are believed to have separated in the mid-1700s, and who roamed large parts of the prairies and mountains of western Alberta well into British Columbia. The secluded Valley of the Ten Peaks was part of their original homeland. Gradually, though, all but three of the mountains were renamed in honour of noteworthy individuals, including Allen himself.Mount Hungabee was not included in the original peak list by Allen, even though it is higher than Wenkchemna Peak, the latter of which is really an extension of Hungabee.The ten peaks, in order of how they are numbered from east to west, are:There are other peaks visible from within the valley as well, including Mount Temple, Mount Babel and Eiffel Peak. Fay Glacier is developed between Mount Babel, Mount Fay, Mount Little and Mount Bowlen.The Valley of the Ten Peaks was featured on the reverse side of the 1969 and 1979 issues of the Canadian twenty dollar bill.The Neil Colgan Hut, a mountaineering destination, can be reached in 8 to 12 hours climbing the Perren Route from Moraine Lake.

Lying on the Bowden Burn, Newtown St Boswells is situated between the larger settlements of St Boswells to the south-east and Melrose to the north-west.Newtown St. Boswells is an old settlement, well-established by the 16th century. The town has been known at various times as Newtoune, Newtown of Eildon, Neuton and Newtown of Dryburgh. It lies split between the civil parishes of Melrose and St Boswells.Historically, Newtown St Boswells was a centre for milling grain, with watermills on its burns). It became a regional centre of communication and an exporter of livestock after the opening of its railway station. This importance has declined since the closure of the station in 1969.From 1975 to 1996, the town served as the administrative centre for Borders Regional Council. Since the reform of local government in Scotland, it has been the centre of the Scottish Borders council area and the Headquarters of the local authority is within the village.A major housing development, which could double the population of the village, has been generally agreed. This will add 900 homes to the village. The re-opening of the Waverley railway line, which connects the nearby village of Tweedbank with Edinburgh, may provide opportunities for the village to become a commuter settlement.Proposals to expand and move the town's livestock auction facilities to the other side of the A68 road were approved in 2007, freeing up space for residential building.The town is served by Newtown Primary School and St Boswells Primary School, which are feeder schools to Earlston High School, located about in Earlston.

  <page name="Kerlingarfjöll">Kerlingarfjöll is a ) tall mountain range in Iceland situated in the Highlands of Iceland near the Kjölur highland road. They are part of a large tuya volcano system of . The volcanic origin of these mountains is evidenced by the numerous hot springs and rivulets in the area, as well as red volcanic rhyolite stone the mountains are composed of. Minerals that have emerged from the hot springs also color the ground yellow, red and green.The area was formerly known for its summer ski resort, but this was dismantled in 2000. From 2000 Kerlingarfjöll have been operated as a highland resort, offering accommodation and food services to the guests in the area.

  <page name="Nollamara">Nollamara is a suburb of Perth, Western Australia. Its local government area is the City of Stirling.The name "Nollamara" is the Aboriginal word for the plant known as the Black Kangaroo Paw.The suburb is less than 10 km away from the Perth CBD and is a 15-minute drive to Trigg beach. Previously known as a lower income area, Nollamara has gone through a period of gentrification over the past decade that continues on to this day. Older homes are being replaced with new townhomes and there has been a surge in young families and professionals populating the suburb.Nollamara borders prominent areas such as Yokine and Dianella that are host to multimillion-dollar homes. This has added to the appeal of Nollamara to new residents as it enjoys much lower housing costs yet is only a stone throw away from more exclusive areas. It also enjoys large parks and open spaces and is known for its extensive amount of trees that line the streets. A newly developed Flinders street and Wanneroo Road provide easy access to Leederville, Subiaco, Northbridge and the Perth CBD. The drive to Leederville, a trendy area full of cafes and restaurants is less than 10 minutes away.The suburb is served by a number of Transperth bus routes operated by Transdev Perth, Swan Transit and Path Transit. The 384 covers the Nollamara Shopping Centre and Wanneroo Road. the 370 and 970 (Mirrabooka-Perth) covers Flinders Street and inner portions of the Suburb, the 389 (Wanneroo-Perth) and the 385/386 (Marangaroo-Perth) covers Wanneroo Road south to Perth, the 371 (Warwick-Mirrabooka) and 415 (Stirling-Mirrabooka) covers Ravenswood Drive in North.

  <page name="Krafla">Krafla is a caldera of about 10 km in diameter with a 90 km long fissure zone, in the north of Iceland in the Mývatn region. Its highest peak reaches up to 818 m and it is 2 km in depth. There have been 29 reported eruptions in recorded history.Krafla includes one of the two best-known Víti craters of Iceland (the other is in Askja). The Icelandic word "víti" means "hell". In former times, people often believed hell to be under volcanoes. The crater Víti has a green lake inside of it.South of the Krafla area, but not actually within the caldera is "Námafjall", a mountain, beneath which is Hverir, a geothermal area with boiling mudpools and steaming fumaroles.The "Mývatn fires" occurred between 1724–1729, when many of the fissure vents opened up. The lava fountains could be seen in the south of the island and a lava flow destroyed three farms near the village of Reykjahlíð, although nobody was harmed.Between 1975 and 1984 there was a volcanic episode within the Krafla volcano. It involved nine volcanic eruptions and fifteen uplift and subsidence events. This interrupted some of the Krafla drillfields. During these events a large magma chamber emerged. This has been identified by analysing the seismic activity.Since 1977 the Krafla area has been the source of the geothermal energy used by a 60 MWe power station. A survey undertaken in 2006 indicated very high temperatures at depths of between 3 and 5 kilometres and these favourable conditions have led to the development of the first well from the Iceland Deep Drilling Project (IDDP), that found magma only 2.1 km deep.

  <page name="Herðubreið">Herðubreið (, "broad-shouldered") is a tuya in north-east Iceland. It is situated in the Highlands of Iceland at the east side of the "Ódáðahraun" desert and close to Askja volcano. The desert is a large lava field originating from eruptions of "Trölladyngja" and other shield volcanoes in the area. Herðubreið was formed beneath the icesheet that covered Iceland during the last glacial period.Due to the mountain's steep and unstable sides, the first ascent was in 1908 despite centuries of knowledge of its existence.Near the mountain lies an oasis called "Herðubreiðarlindir" with a campground and hiking trails. In former times, outcasts who had been excluded from Icelandic society because of crimes they had committed lived at the oasis. One such outlaw was Fjalla-Eyvindur, who lived there during the winter of 1774–1775.

It is the city's 47th administrative neighborhood.Some of the oldest vestiges of human occupation in Paris were found on the territory of Bercy, dating from the late Neolithic (between 4000 and 3800 BC).The name of Bercy, or Bercix, appeared for the first time in property deeds in the twelfth century. The area belonged for a time to the Montmorency family before passing to the Malons family, who had an old manor house expanded by François Le Vau into the Château de Bercy.In the eighteenth century, a large site located along the Seine, contiguous to the Paris city limits of the time, began to be used as a warehousing area, particularly for wine. For two hundred years, the area was the thriving centre of the Paris wine trade and a place with a unique life and culture.Bercy was formerly a commune. In 1860, when Paris annexed its suburban zone, the commune of Bercy was dissolved. The north-west portion of its territory was consolidated into Paris while the south-east portion, beyond the fortifications, was consolidated into Charenton-le-Pont.The area features a number of well-known landmarks:Line 14 of the Métro crosses the neighbourhood.

  <page name="Gardiner Dam">The Gardiner Dam on the South Saskatchewan River in Saskatchewan is the third largest embankment dam in Canada and one of the largest embankment dams in the world. Construction on Gardiner Dam and the smaller Qu'Appelle River Dam was started in 1959 and completed in 1967, creating Lake Diefenbaker upstream and diverting a considerable portion of the South Saskatchewan's flow into the Qu'Appelle River. The dam rises 64 metres (209 feet) in height, is almost long and has a width of at its base with a volume of 65,000,000 cubic meters. The dam is owned and operated by the Saskatchewan Watershed Authority.Danielson Provincial Park has property on both sides of the dam. On the northeast end is the RV park and on the southwest end is a beach, restaurant and guided tours of the Coteau Creek Hydroelectric Station. The park was named after Gustaf Herman Danielson (former Saskatchewan Liberal Party MLA).An integrated power generating plant, SaskPower's Coteau Creek Hydroelectric Station, produces a net 186 MW of electricity from three 62 MW generators. Highway 44 crosses the river atop the dam.The dam is named for a former Premier of Saskatchewan and longtime federal cabinet minister, James G. Gardiner.

  <page name="Red Clay Creek">Red Clay Creek is a tributary of White Clay Creek, running through southeastern Pennsylvania and northern Delaware in the United States. As of 2000, portions of the creek are under wildlife habitat protection.The East and West branches both rise in West Marlborough Township, Chester County, Pennsylvania, near the hamlet of Upland, and flow south through Kennett Square before uniting just north of the Delaware border. The stream enters Delaware near the town of Yorklyn and flows southward through New Castle County, passing through Marshallton. White Clay Creek empties into Red Clay Creek near Stanton, approximately southwest of Wilmington. Ultimately, Red Clay Creek enters the Christina River, also near Stanton.The creek serves as a boundary between the Hundreds of Mill Creek and Christiana. The Wilmington and Western Railroad follows the creek south from Yorklyn as far as Greenbank.In the late 19th Century, several factories were located along Red Clay Creek, including those for the manufacture of flour, wool and iron.The creek suffered from severe flooding in 1999 due to Hurricane Floyd and in 2003 due to Tropical Storm Henri.Since 2000, portions of the river, along with other tributaries of White Clay Creek, have been protected as part of the White Clay Creek Wild and Scenic River.

  <page name="Cohocton River">The Cohocton River, sometimes referred to as the Conhocton River, is a tributary of the Chemung River in western New York in the United States. Via the Chemung River, it is part of the Susquehanna River watershed, flowing to Chesapeake Bay. The name "Cohocton" is derived from an Iroquois term, "Ga-ha-to", meaning "log floating in the water" or "trees in the water".New York State Route 17 follows the valley of the river along much of its route through Steuben County. The river is a popular destination for fly fishing.In the 1820s the New York State Legislature commissioned a study for the building of a canal that would link the Cohocton at Bath to Keuka Lake (Crooked Lake) and Seneca Lake. The Crooked Lake Canal connecting the two lakes was built, but the link to the Cohocton was never completed.The Cohocton River rises in southeastern Livingston County, approximately northeast of Dansville. It flows generally southeast through rural Steuben County, in a winding course through a valley of the Allegheny Plateau, past Cohocton, Avoca and Bath. At Painted Post, just west of Corning, it is joined by the Tioga River from the southwest to form the Chemung, a tributary of the Susquehanna River.The watershed of the Cohocton River is largely undeveloped, with 61.9 percent being forested, 35.8 percent in agriculture, and only 1.5 percent urban.

  <page name="Gehn">The Gehn is a small ridge of hills between Bramsche and Ueffeln in Germany's Central Uplands, that are an extension of the Wiehen Hills ().The ridge runs from northwest to southeast and is about long and an average of wide. The highest point is the Kettelberg which is high. The Gehn forms a link between the "Wiehen Hills" and the Ankum Heights ("Ankumer Höhe"). It is largely forested and is not - like the Ankum Heights- part of a series of ice age terminal moraines from the latest event of the Saalian glaciation, the so-called Drenthe I stage, but is a ridge of Jurassic rock that was pushed up during the folding towards the end of the Cretaceous period.Like the Wiehen Hills and the Ankum Heights, the Gehn belongs to the North Teutoburg Forest-Wiehen Hills Nature Park ("Naturpark Nördlicher Teutoburger Wald-Wiehengebirge").Amongst the main elevations on the Gehn are the:

  <page name="Playa Girón">Playa Girón ("Girón beach") is a beach and village on the east bank of the Bahia de Cochinos (Bay of Pigs), which is located in the province of Matanzas, on the southern coast of Cuba. It is part of the municipality of Ciénaga de Zapata.Playa Girón is located in one of the largest wetlands in the world, the Ciénaga de Zapata (Zapata Swamp). The adjoining village of Girón was named after the notorious French pirate (c.1604).In April 1961, Playa Girón was one of two landing sites for seaborne forces of about 1,500 armed Cuban exiles in the Bay of Pigs Invasion, an American CIA-sponsored attempt to overthrow the new government of Cuban Prime Minister Fidel Castro. Over 72 hours, fighting took place in many parts of the Cienaga de Zapata, Playa Girón being the last remaining area occupied by the invaders. Today, the Museo Girón is a small museum dedicated to the historical conflict.The Cuban folk singer Silvio Rodríguez composed a song called "Playa Girón", dedicated to the fishermen in a boat with that name in which he worked from 1969 to 1970. This song was later included in the album "Dias y Flores" (Day &amp; Flowers), published in 1975. However, the "Playa Girón" theme has a double meaning. It refers to both the boat and the conflict won by Cuban government forces. Not to be confused with "Prelude Giron", another song by Silvio Rodríguez that also addresses the issue of the Bay of Pigs invasion. Another possible explanation, suggested by the lyrics themselves, is that the song is a reference to the preludes of the infamous Quinquenio Gris, the Grey Quinquennial.

  <page name="Hraunfossar">Hraunfossar (Borgarfjörður, western Iceland) is a series of waterfalls formed by rivulets streaming over a distance of about 900 metres out of the Hallmundarhraun, a lava field which flowed from an eruption of one of the volcanoes lying under the glacier Langjökull. The waterfalls pour into the Hvítá river from ledges of less porous rock in the lava. The name "hraun" comes from the Icelandic word for "lava." The Hraunfossar are situated near Húsafell and Reykholt and lava-tube cave Víðgelmir is close by.Literally a stone's throw upstream from Hraunfossar, there is another waterfall called Barnafoss. Its name, the "waterfall of the children", comes from an accident which is said to have taken place here in former times. There was a natural bridge over the waterfall and two children from a nearby farm fell to their deaths crossing the river on the bridge. Afterwards, the grief-struck mother had the bridge destroyed.

  <page name="West Branch Delaware River">The West Branch Delaware River, approximately 90 mi (144 km) long in the U.S. states of New York and Pennsylvania, is one of the two branches, along with the East Branch, that join to form the Delaware River. Along most of its course, it flows through a mountainous area of New York in the western Catskill Mountains.It rises in Schoharie County, New York and flows generally southwest, entering Delaware County and flowing past Stamford and Delhi. In southwestern Delaware County it flows in an increasingly winding course through the mountains, generally southwest. At Stilesville it is impounded to form the Cannonsville Reservoir. At Deposit, on the border between Broome and Delaware counties, it turns sharply to the southeast and is paralleled by New York State Route 17. It joins the East Branch at Hancock to form the Delaware. For the lower 6 mi (10 km) it forms part of the boundary between New York and Pennsylvania.The river below the Cannonsville Dam in Deposit, NY is considered one of the best fly fishing trout streams in the United States, due to the cold water released from the reservoir. The trout population in this river is naturally reproducing, but during the warm months stocked trout from smaller and warmer tributaries will seek sanctuary in its cool water.

  <page name="Ásbyrgi">Ásbyrgi canyon lies in the north of Iceland, about 50 minute drive to the east from Húsavík on the Diamond Circle road. The horseshoe-shaped depression is part of the Vatnajökull National Park and measures approximately 3.5 km in length and 1.1 km across. For more than half of its length, the canyon is divided through the middle by a distinctive rock formation 25 meters high called "Eyjan" ("the Island"), from which hikers may enjoy spectacular views.The canyon's steep sides are formed by cliffs up to 100 metres in height. Down in the canyon, visitors walk through a woodland of birch and willow. Between 1947 and 1977, a number of foreign tree species were introduced, including fir, larch and pine. The small lake "Botnstjörn" is home to a variety of waterfowl species.Ásbyrgi was most likely formed by catastrophic glacial flooding of the river Jökulsá á Fjöllum after the last Ice Age, first 8-10,000 years ago, and then again some 3,000 years ago. The river has since changed its course and now runs about 2 km to the east. The legend explains the unusual shape of the canyon differently. Nicknamed "Sleipnir's footprint", it is said that the canyon was formed when Odin's eight-legged horse, Sleipnir, touched one of its feet to the ground here.

  <page name="Tappan Zee">The Tappan Zee (; also Tappan Sea or Tappaan Zee) is a natural widening of the Hudson River, about 3 mi (5 km) across at its widest, in southeastern New York in the United States. It stretches about 10 mi (16 km) along the boundary between Rockland and Westchester counties, downstream from Croton Point to Irvington. It derives its name from the Tappan Native American sub-tribe of the Delaware/Lenni Lenape, and the Dutch word "zee", meaning a sea.Flanked to the west by high steep bluffs of the New Jersey Palisades in the Hudson Valley, it forms something of a natural lake on the Hudson about 10 mi (16 km) north of Manhattan. Communities along the Tappan Zee include Nyack on the western side as well as Ossining and Tarrytown on the eastern side. It is crossed by the Tappan Zee Bridge, opened in 1955 and about 3.1 mi (5 km) long, connecting Nyack and Tarrytown.On September 14, 1609, the explorer Henry Hudson entered the Tappan Zee while sailing upstream from New York Harbor. At first, Hudson believed the widening of the river indicated that he had found the Northwest Passage. He proceeded upstream as far as present-day Troy before concluding that no such strait existed there.The Tappan Zee is mentioned several times in Washington Irving's famous short story, "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow". The tale is set in the vicinity of Tarrytown, in the area near Irving's own home at Sunnyside.

  <page name="Skeiðará">Skeiðará () is a relatively short glacier river (about 30 km long). It has its source on the glacier Skeiðarárjökull, one of the southern arms of the Vatnajökull in the south of Iceland.In spite of its short length, this river has a bad reputation. It is especially feared because of the frequent glacier runs that can be fatal.In front of Skaftafell and Skeiðarárjökull, Skeiðará has formed the Skeiðarár Sandur, a black plain of lava sand and ashes crossed by a lot of small rivulets which covers the whole area between the park and the sea (about 40 km long and 5 to 10 km wide). In 1996, the latest of these glacier runs took place. It destroyed parts of Route 1 (the Ring Road). The 880 m long bridge was damaged by floating ice boulders the size of houses. At the peak of this glacier run, 45,000 m³/s of water were coming down. No one was harmed, scientists having very carefully monitored the volcano Grímsvötn on Vatnajökull which caused the glacier run by its eruption.

  <page name="Canisteo River">The Canisteo River is a tributary of the Tioga River in western New York in the United States. It drains a dissected plateau, a portion of the northern Allegheny Plateau southwest of the Finger Lakes region, in the far northwestern reaches of the watershed of the Susquehanna River.It rises in the hills of northern Allegany County, approximately southwest of Dansville. It flows east into northern Steuben County, then generally southeast past Hornell and Canisteo. It joins the Tioga from the west in southeastern Steuben County, approximately north of the Pennsylvania state line and southwest of Corning.The name of the river comes from a Native American word meaning either "pickerel" or "head of water". In the 19th century the river valley was the site of an early timber industry. Logs were floated down the river after being cut. As on other rivers in the Susquehanna basin, transportation on the Canisteo before the middle 19th century was often accomplished by arks up to long. The headwaters of the Canisteo were considered to be the farthest navigable headwaters of ark navigation in the Susquehanna watershed.

Its name simply means the "lake of Askja". Like the neighbouring crater Víti, it was created by an enormous volcanic eruption in 1875.On July 10, 1907, two German scientists, Walter von Knebel and Max Rudloff disappeared while exploring the lake in a small boat. Knebel's fiancée, Ina von Grumbkow, led an expedition in search of them with a vulcanologist Hans Reck, but no trace of them was ever found. Suppositions at the time suggested that seismic volcanic disturbances could have caused a landslip or similar occurrence, and recorded that only two days previously the telegraph cable to Iceland had been broken by deep water disturbances for the first time since it was laid, close to the Icelandic coast.

  <page name="Staincross">Staincross is a village in South Yorkshire, England, on the border with West Yorkshire. Historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire, it formed part of the defunct Barnsley West and Penistone borough constituency, following the Boundary Commission for England's report on South Yorkshire's Parliamentary constituencies in 2004 and the subsequent inquiry in 2005, it is now part of the Barnsley Central borough constituency. The population now falls within the Darton East ward of the Metropolitan Borough of Barnsley. The village also gave its name to the Staincross wapentake in the West Riding of Yorkshire.Staincross lies off the A61 road, about three miles north west of Barnsley. It is located at approximately , and at an elevation of around 410 feet (125 m) above sea level. The section of the A61 between Staincross and Newmillerdam is rated in the top three most dangerous roads in Britain according to a survey conducted by The AA Motoring Trust.The name is believed to be derived from a Saxon stone cross ('stane cross') that until the 18th century occupied a position on the junction of Staincross Common - which in itself is an ancient trackway - and Greenside. The stone, now lost, may have been the remains of a rural shrine.After a prolonged campaign (backed by former Test cricket umpire, Dickie Bird, a resident of Staincross), a ballot was held in January 2003 to determine whether the residents of Staincross wanted their mail to include the name of the village. Before the ballot, Staincross mail bore the name of a neighbouring village, either Mapplewell or Darton. Indeed, it is unclear where the boundaries between the three villages lie. Villagers voted overwhelmingly in favour of the proposal by 966 to 199 and Royal Mail implemented changes to officially recognise the village.

  <page name="Vormsi">Vormsi, also Vormsö (, ) is the fourth-largest island of Estonia, located between Hiiumaa and the mainland with a total area of . It is part of Vormsi Parish, a rural municipality.Vormsi's history as an inhabited island dates back as far as the 13th century. During most of its history, the island has been inhabited by Estonian Swedes ("rannarootslased" in Estonian or "coastal Swedes" in English), whose population reached 3,000 before World War II. During the war, nearly all of Vormsi's population, along with other Swedes living in Estonia, were evacuated, or fled, to Sweden. The island's current population is approximately 240 inhabitants.The island's Estonian name Vormsi is derived from its German name Worms or its Swedish name Ormsö. Swedish influence can also be seen in other place names, as in villages like Hullo (the administrative center), Sviby (the main port), Söderby, Norrby, Diby, Rälby, Förby, Borrby, Kärrslätt, Saxby, Busby, Suuremõisa (Magnushof, formerly Busby) and Rumpo; and lakes like Prästvik.Vormsi is the per capita wealthiest island and region in Estonia outside of the Tallinn metro area, with incomes on the same level as inner Tallinn in Estonia. This is attributed to the fact that many wealthy people own summer homes on the island and are registered as residents, so their yearly income tax is forwarded to the island's budget.Vormsi has no industrial activity. The island earns the majority of its revenues from taxation of mainland and overseas income of residents.The island of Vormsi has homeowners from several countries: Estonia, Sweden, Finland, SwitzerlandIt is believed that a Viking from Iceland called Orms was the first man to have landed on the island and started a colony. Ormsö in Swedish means "Orm's Island". "Orms" also means "snake" in Swedish.

  <page name="Eatonia">Eatonia is a small town in the Province of Saskatchewan, Canada with a population of 449 people (according to the Canada 2006 Census). The town's economy is based almost exclusively on agriculture. Eatonia is in southwest Saskatchewan at the crossroads of Highways 21 and 44, approximately 44 kilometers southwest of Kindersley and 72 kilometres from the provincial boundary with Alberta. The town is served by Eatonia (Elvie Smith) Municipal Airport.Eatonia was founded in 1919 as a station on the Canadian National Railway and was named after Timothy Eaton, founder of the Eaton's department store chain and catalogue, and to honour his son and heir, John Craig Eaton. The station was originally simply called "Eaton", but there was confusion with nearby Eston, so the name was changed to Eatonia in 1921 ("Eatonia" was the name of an Eaton's brand for clothing and other goods, and "Eatonian" was the name given to long-serving Eaton's employees).Eatonia was incorporated as a town in 1954. In 1955, the year of Saskatchewan's Golden Jubilee, Eatonia's train station was featured on the cover of the Eaton's catalogue, thus resulting in a classic local image finding its way into homes across the country. The former CN train station is now home to the Wheatland Regional Library (Eatonia Branch). The former station, along with a train caboose and a wood-frame house ordered from the Eaton's catalogue in 1917, comprise the Eatonia Heritage Park, a Municipal Heritage Property located at the south end of Main Street.The population of Eatonia dropped 5.3% between the 2001 and 2006 censuses.Eatonia is home to a kindergarten to Grade 12 public school, Eaton School, which has been home to many successful volleyball, basketball, and football teams throughout its history. It is located within the Sun West School Division.

  <page name="Yamhill River">The Yamhill River is an tributary of the Willamette River, in the U.S. state of Oregon. Formed by the confluence of the South Yamhill River and the North Yamhill River about east of McMinnville, it drains part of the Northern Oregon Coast Range. The river meanders east past Dayton to join the Willamette River at its river mile (RM) 55 or river kilometer (RK) 89, south of Newberg.It is likely that Yamhill was the 19th century white settlers' name for a tribe of Native Americans, a Kalapuya people who inhabited the region. The Yamhill people were among 27 bands and tribes moved to the Grand Ronde Indian Reservation, formally established in 1857.Formed by the confluence of the South Yamhill and North Yamhill rivers about east of McMinnville, the main stem Yamhill River flows generally east for about to the Willamette River, a tributary of the Columbia River. At about RM 9 (RK 14), Hawn Creek and then Millican Creek enter from the left as the Yamhill nears Lafayette, which lies to the river's left. Beyond Lafayette, Henry Creek enters from the left. Near Dayton, the river passes under Oregon Route 18 before skirting the city, which lies to its right at RM 5 (RK 8). Here Palmer Creek enters from the right. Below Dayton, the river enters the Willamette at its RM 55 (RK 89) south of Newberg.In 1900 a Yamhill River lock and dam lock and dam was completed about 1.5 miles downriver from Lafayette, Oregon. The lock was decommissioned in 1954. The dam was deliberately destroyed in 1963 to allow better passage for salmon on the river. The site of the lock and dam is now a county park.

  <page name="San Rafael River">The San Rafael River is a tributary of the Green River, approximately long, in east central Utah in the United States. The river flows across a sparsely populated arid region of the Colorado Plateau, and is known for the isolated, scenic gorge through which it flows.It rises in northwestern Emery County, approximately southeast of Castle Dale, by the confluence of Cottonwood, Huntington, and Ferron creeks, which provide its headwaters in the Wasatch Plateau region. It flows ESE along the north side of the Coal Cliffs and the prominent anticline called the San Rafael Swell, passing north of Window Butte (Window Blind Peak) and through two narrow slot canyons in Coconino Sandstone called the Upper and Lower Black Box. This area is known as the San Rafael Gorge, sometimes called the "Little Grand Canyon". (Actually, the "Little Grand Canyon" is a few miles upstream where the San Rafael passes between the Wedge on the north and Sid's Mountain and No Man's Mountain on the south). After passing through the San Rafael Reef it enters the 15 mile (24 km) long San Rafael Valley, where it joins the Green River from the west, approximately south of the town of Green River. The San Rafael is the last major tributary of the Green before it joins the Colorado River in Canyonlands National Park.Diversion tunnels at the headwaters of the river in the Manti-La Sal National Forest provide irrigation water to Sanpete County on the west side of the Wasatch Plateau.

  <page name="Lake Koocanusa">Lake Koocanusa is a reservoir in British Columbia (Canada) and Montana (United States) formed by the damming of the Kootenay River by the Libby Dam in 1972. The Dam was formally dedicated by President Gerald Ford on August 24, 1975.The lake is formed north of the dam, reaching to the Canada–United States border and further into British Columbia. The lake holds 13% of the water in the Columbia River system. The town of Rexford was moved, as well as the Great Northern Railroad line. The town of Waldo, BC is now covered by the lake. What was once a barrier to river travel, Jennings Canyon is now inundated by the lake.Lake Koocanusa was named in a contest won by Alice Beers of Rexford, Montana. The name is made from the first three letters of the Kootenay (alternately, Kootenai) River, Canada, and USA.Lake Koocanusa was built as a joint project of the U.S. and Canada. It is 26 km (16 mi) from Libby, Montana, also on the Kootenai River, from which the dam gets its name. Libby Dam has a Visitors Center and can be accessed by the Lake Koocanusa Scenic Byway which begins in the nearby town of Libby, Montana.The Pacific Northwest National Scenic Trail follows Highway 37 along the east side of the lake before crossing over the Lake Koocanusa Bridge and climbing up Webb Mountain.

  <page name="Carson Sink">Carson Sink is a playa in the northeastern portion of the Carson Desert that was formerly the terminus of the Carson River. The sink is currently fed by drainage canals of the Truckee-Carson Irrigation District. The southeastern fringe of the sink where the canals enter is a wetland of the Central Basin and Range ecoregion, which is mostly included within the Fallon National Wildlife Refuge and the Stillwater Wildlife Management Area. This area serves as an important stopover for migrating waterfowl. The Sehoo Formation is in the south of the Carson Sink.The Carson Sink and Lone Rock working areas are the northwest portion of both the Carson Sink and the Fallon Range Training Complex. The Lone Rock working area includes the Bravo-20 range which has numerous targets for combat aircraft training. Lone Rock is in the middle of a Bravo-20 live bombing area and is a solitary pinnacle of rock through the playa that is held sacred by the Paiute.The Carson Sink was a deep portion of the Pleistocene water body Lake Lahontan, the lakebed of which is now the Lahontan Basin.The Carson Trail used during the California Gold Rush across the Lahontan Basin included a section from through the Forty Mile Desert to the first drinkable water on the Carson River. The Carson Sink station of the Pony Express was built in March, 1860.In 1984, the natural dike between the Carson Sink and the Humboldt Sink was breached by the Nevada Department of Transportation to prevent Interstate 80 and the town of Lovelock from flooding due to unusually heavy snowfall in the preceding three years. The sinks remained connected by water for 3 years, until 1987.

  <page name="Meadow Valley Wash">The Meadow Valley Wash is a southern Nevada stream draining the Meadow Watershed that is bordered on 3 sides by the Great Basin Divide. The wash's Lincoln County headpoint is in the Wilson Creek Range, and the wash includes 2 upper confluences (e.g., the Patterson Wash). Panaca is along the upper wash, and downstream of Caliente is the wash's confluence with its east fork. Just prior to the junction with the Muddy River, the wash flows from Lincoln County into northeastern Clark County. It flows into the Muddy in the Moapa Valley just west of Glendale adjacent to Interstate 15 approximately northwest of Las Vegas.In addition to the Wilson Creek Range, the watershed's drainage divide is in the Delamar Mountains (to the west) and the Meadow Valley Range (east). The northern tip of the watershed is a triple watershed point with 2 Great Basin subregions, the Central Nevada Desert Basins &amp; the Escalante-Sevier subregion.William Andrews Clark's 1903-1910 railroad that linked Pioche and Panaca operated through the wash until washed out by flooding.

  <page name="West Humboldt Range">The West Humboldt Range is a short mountain range in the western Great Basin in northwestern Nevada in the United States.The mountain range runs for approximately 40 mi (64 km) southwest to northeast in northern Churchill County and southern Pershing County. The southwest end of the range is approximately 60 mi (100 km) ENE of Reno.The range separates the lower course and terminus-(Humboldt Lake) of the Humboldt River and the Humboldt Sink on the northwest side from the expansive Carson Sink on the south and southeast side. Interstate 80 follows the course of the Humboldt along the northwest side of the range. During the last ice age, the range stood along the shore of Lake Lahontan, the prehistoric shorelines and beaches of which are visible along the sides of the range.Few peaks in the range are named; one of the few with an official name is Topog Peak in northern Churchill County, near the southwestern end of the range.In 1905 the Saurian Expedition, led by John C. Merriam and financed by Annie Alexander, explored the Triassic limestones of the range, discovering 25 specimens of Ichthyosaur.

  <page name="Reykjahlíð">The village of Reykjahlíð has approximately 300 inhabitants and is situated on the shores of Lake Mývatn in the north of Iceland. It is the seat of the municipality of Skútustaðahreppur.During the so-called Mývatn fires, caused by the eruption of the nearby volcano Krafla in 1729, the village was destroyed by a lava stream. However, the inhabitants were saved when the lava flow stopped in front of the village church on higher ground, allegedly as the result of the prayers of the village priest. The church is still there, although the present building dates from 1972.From Reykjahlíð, it is possible to go to many sights in the area, most notably Krafla. The volcano last erupted in 1984, but the vapour of a warm lava field and of sulphur springs can still be seen. Not far from there is the crater Víti (meaning "hell" in Icelandic), but looking today rather harmless with a blue lake at its bottom. Its apparent tranquility belies the fact that its last eruption was as recent as 1976.Other interesting places are on the lake itself, like the volcano Hverfjall, the pseudo-craters of Skútusstaðir and Dimmuborgir (a strange lava formation).A local airport provides sightseeing during the summer.A plant for extraction and processing of diatomite was a main point in local economy until 2004 when it was shut down.Mývatn Nature Baths opened on 30 June 2004.

It also houses the Egyptian Air Force Academy complex, which contains the town's largest public school in Al-Zafer.The mosque of Sadat Qureish, which is the oldest mosque in Egypt, and one may say the entire continent of Africa, is located in Belbeis.The city was important enough in the Roman province of Augustamnica Secunda to become a bishopric.The city played a role in the machinations for control of the Fatimid vizierate: first in 1164, when Shirkuh was besieged in the city by the combined forces of Shiwar and crusader king Amalric I of Jerusalem for three months; then again in 1168 when the city was assaulted again by Amalric's army, who took the city after three days on 4 November and indiscriminately killed the inhabitants. This angered the Coptic Egyptians, who had seen the Crusaders as deliverers but had suffered as much as the Muslim inhabitants of Bilbeis. The Copts ended their support of the Crusaders and united with their non-Christian neighbors against the foreigners. (See Crusader invasion of Egypt.)In 1798, its fortifications were rebuilt at the order of Napoleon.The bishopric, a suffragan of the Metropolitan of provincial capital Leontopolis, faded.The diocese of Phelbes was nominally restored in 1933 as a Latin Catholic titular bishopric.It has had the following incumbents, all of the lowest (episcopal) rank :Bilbeis is classified by Köppen-Geiger climate classification system as hot desert (BWh), as the rest of Egypt.

It is named after the nearby Castle Mountain, clearly visible from the junction.Work started here in 1910 on the Auto Route of the Great Divide, a project to build a highway across the Rocky Mountains, when construction began on a road from Castle Junction to Banff. Following an interruption caused by the outbreak of World War I, construction wrapped up between 1920 and 1922 when the newly constructed road between Calgary and Banff was joined to the Windermere Highway via the road between Castle Junction and Banff.Prime Minister Mackenzie King changed the name of Castle Mountain to Mount Eisenhower in 1946 to honour the World War II general Dwight D. Eisenhower. Correspondingly, Castle Junction was called Eisenhower Junction. Castle Mountain was officially restored to its original name in 1979, at which time Eisenhower Junction was also renamed Castle Junction.A group of lodges and the Castle Mountain campground are located within a kilometre of the junction. Several hiking trails are available in the vicinity. The trailhead for hikes to Silverton Falls and Rockbound Lake is located approximately 200 metres east of Castle Junction. The remains of Silver City, a 19th-century settlement founded by prospectors at the base of Castle Mountain, are located nearby. Also nearby is the site of the Castle Mountain Internment Camp used during World War I.

The other lower peak is named South Twin (3,566 m). North Twin is the third highest peak in the Canadian Rockies, after Mount Robson and Mount Columbia.The massif was named "The Twins" in 1898 by J. Norman Collie and Hugh M. Stutfield. The decision to name the peaks separately was approved February 28, 1980.In addition to North Twin and South Twin, the massif contains a northern subpeak of North Twin known as Twins Tower, . This sits atop the famed north face of the massif (see below), and was named in 1984.The first ascent of North Twin was recorded on 10 July 1923 by W.S. Ladd, J.M. Thorington, and Conrad Kain, via the East Face.The normal route is a ski mountaineering climb on the eastern slopes, and it is possible to ski all the way to the summit. A traverse can be made to the South Twin, although an ice axe is recommended for the narrow connecting ridge.The nearly vertical north face drops over from Twins Tower to the Athabasca River - the true summit of North Twin is somewhat removed from the top of the north face.

It should not be confused with Old Dongola, an ancient city located 80 km upstream on the opposite bank.Dongola was also a province of Upper Nubia on both sides of the Nile and a centre for Nubian civilization as manifested by its many archaeological remains from the Makurian and Islamic periods. The remains of the revered Baqt Treaty are to be found in Dongola. The province of Dongola was part of the Makuria kingdom, which later became part of Egypt after Muhammad Ali Pasha ordered for the invasion and occupation of Sudan in 1820 after which it was designated as a seat of a pasha. Its first governor was Abidin Bey.Dongola was the scene of a victory by General Herbert Kitchener over the indigenous Mahdist Muslim tribes in 1896. Dongola Road in the Bishopston area of Bristol was named after this event. So was Dongola Road in Tottenham, North London which runs next to Kitchener Road. There is also a Dongola Road in Jersey (Channel Islands).The Latin Catholic Diocese of Dongola was established in 1330 and suppressed in 1350. No incumbent is recorded.The Nile Expedition of 1884–1885 to relieve Gordon at Khartoum passed through the area. Regiments were challenged to race up the river by boat, and this gave rise to the English regatta competition of dongola racing.Dongola has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification "BWh"). Dongola is located in one of the hottest, sunniest and driest regions in the world.The town is home to the University of Dongola, a public university.

  <page name="Hukvaldy">Hukvaldy () is a village in the Czech Republic, in the Moravian-Silesian Region. Population: 1,900. It lies 150m below the ruins of the third-largest castle in the Czech Republic, Hukvaldy Castle (Hrad Hukvaldy), and is the birthplace of the composer Leoš Janáček and palaeontologist Ferdinand Stoliczka.The castle has been rebuilt at least five times over the last 700 years, evolving from a small early gothic castle to a baroque fortress. It was first built between 1260 and 1270 by Mr. Frank from Příbor. He was the son of the colonizer Arnold from the Huckeswagen family. When it functioned as a defensive structure the castle was never taken, probably because of its location and its massive fortress. The oldest part is an oval with many walls and a tall slim tower in the front. Above the ditch and entrance to the castle there is a dwelling building on the other side of the structure. After 1469 the castle was completely rebuilt by Bishop Tas of Boskovice. In 1762 there was a fire in the castle and it was completely destroyed. In the 20th century the castle was abandoned and it fell into ruins. Much repair has been done, but the castle is still undergoing restoration. The best-preserved structure is St. Andrew´s hapel, where many concerts take place, enhanced by the excellent acoustics. Weddings also take place in the chapel. The castle is administered by Fond Janáčkovy Hukvaldy and is open from April until October. Nearby is a park where we can see mouflons, and there is also an amphitheatre.

  <page name="Wailuku River">The Wailuku River is a water course on the Island of Hawaii in the Hawaiian Islands. It is the longest river in Hawai'i and its course lies mostly along the divide between the lava flows of Mauna Kea and those of Mauna Loa to the south. It arises at about the elevation along the eastern slope of Mauna Kea (). It flows generally eastward, descending steeply from the mountain and entering the Pacific Ocean at Hilo.Wailuku River State Park is located along the lower reach of the river. One section of the park includes Rainbow Falls (), and another section Peepee falls and an area called the Boiling Pots (a series of small falls and pools). The upper and middle reaches of the river are known for hunting of introduced game animals. The lower river is a popular destination for swimming and tubing. However the Wailuku River (which includes Boiling Pots) accounts for 25% of the river drowning deaths in the state.The lower reach of the river is used for the generation of hydroelectricity. The flow at Hilo averages 275 cubic feet per second (8 m³/s) with peak flows 40 times as great. The stream carries an average of 10 tons of suspended sediment into Hilo Bay each day, at .In the Hawaiian language, "wai" means fresh water and "luku" means destruction, so it means essentially River of Destruction. The river can rise into the trees and drop back down very fast.The high flood marks can be seen dated in concrete, on the stairs going down to the river behind the Hilo Public Library.

It flows generally west-northwest through the mountains, past Swisshome, entering the Pacific at Florence. The head of tide is upstream.It is part of the homeland of the Siuslaw people, after whom it is named. Citizens of the Siuslaw nation lived in villages along the river until 1860 when they were forcibly removed to an Indian reservation in Yachats whereupon their homes, farms, gardens and villages were destroyed and occupied by U.S. settler-colonists.The valley of the river has been one of the productive timber regions in Oregon. The lower course of the river passes through Siuslaw National Forest.The Coos Bay branch of the Coos Bay Rail Link crosses many bridges as it follows the narrow, winding valley of the Siuslaw River to the swing bridge at Cushman.The river has historically been a spawning ground for Chinook and coho salmon. Although the Chinook population is substantial, coho numbers have declined from an annual average of 209,000 fish between 1889 and 1896 to just over 3,000 fish between 1990 and 1995. The estuary of the river is surrounded by extensive wetlands that are a significant habitat for migratory birds along the coast. It is one of the very few Western Oregon rivers where all major forks are undammed.

  <page name="Riverside Geyser">Riverside Geyser is a geyser in Yellowstone National Park in the U.S. state of Wyoming.The geyser is located on the Firehole River within the Upper Geyser Basin. The geyser shoots steam and water to heights of 75 feet (23 m) in an arch over the river, sometimes causing brilliant rainbows. The eruptions occur every 5⁄ to 7 hours. As is Daisy, Riverside is one of the most predictable geysers in the park, because it is not located near any other geysers that may disrupt the flow of underground water in the geyser's plumbing. Riverside is unique in its way that eruptions seldom occur at the average interval for any given time. Instead, Riverside is bimodal, meaning it usually erupts 20 minutes before or 25 minutes late for a duration of 20 minutes. The bimodality does not represent a problem for predictions if the previous erupt time is seen. If not, you are predicting on doubles and triples, which leads to a wide range for uncertainty. For an hour or two before the eruption, water pours over the edge of the cone. The geyser was named by the Hayden Geological Survey of 1871.The geyser is one of the most reliable geysers in Yellowstone, despite the moniker and reputation of the better-known Old Faithful.

  <page name="Uxbridge Vine Street railway station">Uxbridge Vine Street station opened on 8 September 1856 as "Uxbridge Station" and was the earliest of three railway stations in Uxbridge, London, in the UK. It was the northern terminus of the Great Western Railway Uxbridge branch from the main line at . South from Uxbridge town centre the line ran near Whitehall Road and Cleveland Road.In 1863, a plan was approved to construct an extension of the Uxbridge Branch to create a link northwards to in Hertfordshire via , connecting it to the Watford and Rickmansworth Railway (W&amp;RR). The scheme never went ahead as the GWR withdrew its funding.In November 1885, the Staines West branch opened sharing a short section of the Vine Street branch to connect to the main line. An intermediate station at Cowley opened in 1904.The Uxbridge Branch continued to be operated under British Rail until 10 September 1962, when the service from West Drayton was withdrawn and Uxbridge Vine Street station was closed to passengers. Goods traffic ceased two years later and the only stretch of the line north of West Drayton to survive longer than this was that as far as Middlesex Oil Depot, some distance south of Cowley, which closed in 1979. Demolition of Uxbridge Vine Street station occurred in 1969. Hillingdon Road now covers its site.

  <page name="Los Hornos">Los Hornos is a distinct neighbourhood ("barrio") in La Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina.Formerly a separate settlement, it now belongs to the "Greater La Plata" urban conglomerate. Its name, (Spanish for "the [brick] ovens" or "the furnaces"), refers to the several brick factories that were located in the area at the end of the 19th century, and which supplied the bricks for many of the buildings in the nascent city of La Plata. The area was heavily settled by Italian immigrants, and became renowned for its many family orchards. The "barrio" still retains a distinct personality and atmosphere within La Plata.In Los Hornos we can find the municipal cemetery, a protected local landmark, and the Parish St. Benjamin.

  <page name="Mount Hubbard">Mount Hubbard is one of the major mountains of the Saint Elias Range. It is located on the Alaska/Yukon border; the Canadian side is within Kluane National Park and Reserve, and the American side is part of Wrangell–St. Elias National Park. The mountain was named in 1890 by U.S. Geological Survey geologist Israel Russell after Gardiner Greene Hubbard, first president of the National Geographic Society, which had co-sponsored Russell's expedition.Hubbard is the highest point of a large massif with three named summits; the other two are Mount Alverstone and Mount Kennedy. Alverstone and Hubbard form a corner of the Canada–United States border: the border extends roughly south from these peaks toward the Alaska panhandle, and roughly west toward Mount Saint Elias, approximately away. The Hubbard Glacier separates Mount Hubbard from Mount Vancouver to the west, while the Lowell Glacier lies to the east of the peak.Mount Hubbard is the eighth-highest peak in the United States, and the twelfth-highest peak in Canada. It is also notable for its large rise above local terrain. For example, its west face rises above the Alverstone Glacier in less than , and the peak rises above the Hubbard Glacier to the southwest in only . Mount Hubbard is just over from tidewater at Disenchantment Bay. However, despite its precipitous drops to the west, the eastern side provides a non-technical (though long) route to the summit.

Dating to 1681, the countship was associated with members of the Dano-Norwegian noble family, Wedel-Jarlsberg.Jarlsberg was originally created as a countship in 1673 for Peder Schumacher Griffenfeld, a Danish statesman and Chancellor of Denmark during the reign of King Christian V of Denmark. The creation involved that Count Griffenfeld, in addition to owning 14 percent of the countship’s land, received large tax revenues and also the right to appoint all civil and ecclesiastical officials, including officers and judges, who would serve within the countship.After Griffenfeld’s arrest in 1676 in the aftermath of the Scanian War, his properties were transferred by King Christian V to Ulrik Fredrik Gyldenløve, the Count of Larvik. Gyldenløve, an illegitimate son of King Frederick III of Denmark, was the Viceroy ("Statholder") of Norway.In 1683, Ulrik Fredrik Gyldenløve sold the countship to Gustav Frederik Wilhelm Wedel. Field Marshal Wedel, who had become commanding General in Norway in 1681, received the title "Wedel af Jarlsberg" in 1684 and introduced the name Jarlsberg, which means ‘Earl’s Hill’.

There are only a few small patches of flat land on its shores. There are many small creeks draining the surrounding hills, but no significant rivers flow into Middle Harbour.Within Middle Harbour are, from upstream to downstream, Shell Cove, Pearl Bay, Long Bay, Sugarloaf Bay, Bantry Bay, Fisher Bay, Sandy Bay, Sailors Bay, Powder Hulk Bay, Willoughby Bay and Quakers Hat Bay.Middle Harbour is a significant physical barrier between Sydney and the suburbs known as the Northern Beaches area which lie north and east of Middle Harbour.There are only two bridges - the Spit Bridge and the Roseville Bridge. Because of this obstacle, historically the main transport between Manly and Sydney was by ferry.Since the 1920s, most of the land on the ridge-tops around Middle Harbour have been developed for suburban housing. Much of the rugged shore of the Middle Harbour remains covered with bushland, most of it now protected by parks and reserves. Middle Harbour is a popular area for recreational boating and fishing.

It drains a cotton and tobacco-growing region of the Piedmont and coastal plain southwest of Richmond.The English colonists in Virginia at first tried to rename the Appomattox as the "Bristoll River", however this name did not catch on, while the native one did. There are numerous historical spelling variants, such as Apamatuck, Apamutiky, Appamattuck, Appomattake, and Apumetecs, among others.The Appomattox River rises in the Piedmont of northeastern Appomattox County, approximately northeast of the town of Appomattox. It flows generally southeast through the Appomattox-Buckingham State Forest to Farmville. From Farmville it flows in a large arc northeast then southeast across the coastal plain, passing southwest of Richmond and passing through the Lake Chesdin reservoir. It flows through Petersburg, its head of navigation, through the Tri-cities area, then joins the James River from the west at City Point in Hopewell.In April 1865 during the Appomattox Campaign of the American Civil War, the Confederate forces attempted to burn the High Bridge over the river northwest of Burkeville in order to escape the pursuing Union Army after the fall of Petersburg. The Union capture of the bridge was a contributing factor in the forcing of General Robert E. Lee's surrender at nearby Appomattox Court House, ending the war in Virginia.The river is a popular destination for whitewater rafting and canoeing, particularly down stream of the small Abutment Dam (which is itself only a couple miles down stream of Chesdin Dam) in the village of Matoaca to Petersburg near Virginia State University.

  <page name="Auglaize River">The Auglaize River (Shawnee: Kathinakithiipi) is a tributary of the Maumee River in northwestern Ohio in the United States. It drains a primarily rural farming area in the watershed of Lake Erie. The name of the river may come from the French words for "frozen water" ("eau glacée"), unless it originates from "glaise" (clay).It rises in southeastern Allen County, approximately southeast of Lima and north of Indian Lake. It flows southwest to Wapakoneta, then generally north in a zigzag course, past Delphos, Fort Jennings and Oakwood.

It joins the Auglaize from the east in western Putnam County approximately north of Cloverdale at .The river is named for Jean Jacques Blanchard, a French tailor who settled among the Shawnee along the river in 1769. Fort Findlay, an American outpost in the War of 1812, was constructed along the river in 1812 at the site of the present-day city of Findlay.In 1908, Tell Taylor wrote Down by the Old Mill Stream, a popular song of the early 20th Century and a barbershop favorite, while sitting on the banks of the Blanchard River.in August 2007 flooding along the Blanchard River caused more than $100 million in damage in Findlay and an estimated $12 million in damage in Ottawa. Flooding in Ottawa is aggravated by the low bridge carrying County Road I-9 in Putnam County. It traps debris, forming a dam during floods. Flooding also caused damage in Findlay in March 2011.On November 28, 2012, officials from Hancock and Putnam counties traveled to Washington D.C. to lobby for $1.7 million in federal funding to complete phase three of the Blanchard River Flood Mitigation study.According to the Geographic Names Information System, the Blanchard River has also been known as:

  <page name="Wallowa River">The Wallowa River is a tributary of the Grande Ronde River, approximately long, in northeastern Oregon in the United States. It drains a valley on the Columbia Plateau in the northeast corner of the state north of Wallowa Mountains.The river begins at the confluence of its east and west forks, which rise in southern Wallowa County, in the Eagle Cap Wilderness of the Wallowa–Whitman National Forest. It flows generally northwest through the Wallowa Valley, past the communities of Joseph, Enterprise, and Wallowa. It receives the Minam River from the left at the hamlet of Minam. Continuing north another , it joins the Grande Ronde along the Wallowa–Union county line about north-northeast of Elgin and about from the larger river's confluence with the Snake River.The Wallowa Valley was home to Chief Joseph's band of the Nez Perce Tribe. Chief Joseph asked the first white settlers to leave when they arrived in 1871. The U.S. government expelled the tribe and seized their property and livestock in 1877, when non-Indian farmers and ranchers wanted to settle the fertile Wallowa valley. The tribe was barred from returning to their homeland by the government after repeated petitions. The tribal members were shipped in unheated box cars to Indian Territory (now Oklahoma) to be placed in a prisoner of war camp never to see their home again.The Wallowa River supports populations of steelhead, spring Chinook salmon, and mountain whitefish among other species. Sockeye salmon were extirpated from the Wallowa River when a small dam was constructed at the outlet of Wallowa Lake in the headwaters of the river. The dam was constructed to raise the level of the lake to store water for irrigation.

  <page name="Sierra Nevada de Lagunas Bravas">Sierra Nevada, also known as Sierra Nevada de Lagunas Bravas, is a major ignimbrite-lava dome complex which lies in both Chile and Argentina in one of the most remote parts of the Central Andes. Activity in the complex started in Argentina and formed two stratovolcanoes. Later, 12 or more vents formed, some with craters up to wide. Lava flows up to long with flow ridges are also found. It covers a total area of 225 km². Together with Cerro el Condor and Peinado it forms the Culampaja line, a line of volcanoes that reaches Cerro Blanco. Strong seismic attenuation is observed beneath Sierra Nevada. Hydrothermally altered rocks in Sierra Nevada may be the source of sulfate and in the Juncalito and Negro rivers.Sierra Nevada is a remote peak on the Chile-Argentina border. As such it was probably the second last 6000m+ peak in the Andes to be climbed, the first recorded ascent being in December 2000. The snowline in the area lies at altitude at Cumbre del Laudo.

  <page name="Santa Ana Volcano">The Santa Ana Volcano or Ilamatepec () is a large stratovolcano located in the Santa Ana department of El Salvador. At 2,381 metres above sea level, it is the highest volcano in the country. It is located immediately west of Coatepeque Caldera.The volcano was the inspiration for one of the active volcanoes in Antoine de Saint-Exupéry's famous French novella (The Little Prince), based on his life with his Salvadoran wife Consuelo de Saint Exupéry, who was The Rose in the story.The summit of Santa Ana features four nested calderas and volcanic craters, with the innermost containing a small crater lake. Collapse of the summit during the late Pleistocene (inferring from underlying soil samples, the upper age limit is no more than 57 000 years ago) produced a massive debris avalanche that reached the Pacific Ocean, forming the Acajutla Peninsula. Subsequent eruptions have largely rebuilt the edifice.There have been numerous historical eruptions since the 16th century, both at the summit and from cinder cones on the lower flanks, and also the flank vents of San Marcelino located east of Santa Ana. The San Marcelino vents erupted in 1722 and flowed eastwards for 11 km, destroying the village of San Juan Tecpan.In October, 2005, the volcano erupted, killing at least two people, injuring seven people, forcing many people to flee their villages. The volcano spat rocks for over with rocks the size of cars. The eruption contributed to the damage from Hurricane Stan. The most recent previous eruption had been in 1904.The climate on the northeast facing slope of the volcano sees substantial rainfall in the summer months. Located at 13.9 N, 89.6 W, altitude : 1770 m, the climate is classified as a subtropical highland climate (Köppen "Cwb").

  <page name="Dirty Devil River">The Dirty Devil River is an tributary of the Colorado River, located in the U.S. state of Utah. It flows through southern Utah from the confluence of Fremont River and Muddy Creek to the Colorado River.The Dirty Devil River is formed in Wayne County near Hanksville at the confluence of the Fremont River and Muddy Creek. It flows generally south through a deep canyon in Wayne and Garfield counties. Its lower flows through Glen Canyon National Recreation Area. It disembogues into Lake Powell on the Colorado.The canyon of the river is particularly isolated and is seldom visited compared to other natural areas in the region. The average discharge is approximately 446 cfs.The Dirty Devil River was named during the 1869 Colorado River expedition led by John Wesley Powell.The outlaw Butch Cassidy used tributary canyons of the Dirty Devil, such as Robbers Roost, as a hideout in the 1890s.The Dirty Devil River and its tributaries contribute approximately 150,000 tons of salt to the Colorado River each year, with the Muddy Creek tributary contributing an annual average of 86,000 tons by itself. The Fremont River tributary does not contribute significant amounts of salt. The United States Bureau of Reclamation has created a plan to reduce the salinity of the Dirty Devil River by collecting salty spring water and using deep-well injection to dispose of it. The plan, completed in 1987, has not been implemented due to its marginal cost effectiveness.The river is spanned by a steel arch bridge on State Route 95 near milepost 45 in Garfield County.

  <page name="Damwâld">Damwâld () is a village in the Dantumadiel municipality of Friesland, in the Netherlands and has around 5600 citizens (2014). This number of citizens makes Damwâld the largest village in the municipality of Dantumadiel.Before 1971, this village was three villages, Dantumawoude, Akkerwoude and Murmerwoude. Before 1881, the city hall of Dantumadeel was in the village of Rinsumageest. After 1881, the town hall moved to Murmerwoude. Another village in Dantumadeel, Zwaagwesteinde, claimed the town hall, because it had the largest population. To eventually solve this problem, the local government fused the three small towns into one, so it would have the largest population. The first letter of each smaller village made up the first three letters of the new name.

  <page name="Staats Island">Staats Island is an uninhabited island of the Beaver Island Group in the Falkland Islands. It lies between Beaver Island and Weddell Island, parallel to Tea Island and is in area.The island is known for its Patagonian foxes and guanacos, both introduced species; the former is not to be confused with the closely related Falkland Islands fox now extinct. The introduction of guanaco has led to overgrazing of the tussac while the introduction of foxes has had a negative effect on the resident birds and there is an eradication programme to eliminate foxes from this and other islands in the Beaver Island GroupThe guanaco population, from 15 animals introduced in 1938-39, rapidly grew to around 275 by 1956, when culling began in order to replace them with sheep. By the early 1960s, they had been reduced to around 10-20 animals. The population oscillated between a few hundred and a few dozen, with repeated culling; as of 2004, the population had risen back to around 400 animals. Other introduced species in the 1930s included a pair of lesser rheas (known to Falklanders as "ostriches") and a number of Humboldt's hog-nosed skunks; the rheas did not establish themselves, as their nests were raided by the foxes, but the skunks lasted until at least 1956.Other wildlife on the island includes Magellanic penguins and other seabirds.

  <page name="Tirich Mir">Tirich Mir (Khowar/) (alternatively Terich Mir, Terichmir and Turch Mir) is the highest mountain of the Hindu Kush range, and the highest mountain in the world outside of the Himalayas-Karakoram range, located in Chitral-District of Pakistan. The mountain was first climbed in 1950 by a Norwegian expedition consisting of Arne Næss, P. Kvernberg, H. Berg, and Tony Streather. Tirich Mir overlooks Chitral town, and can be easily seen from the main bazaar.The last village in Chitral before reaching Tirich Mir is the village of Tirich. It is located in Mulkow. The people there speak the Khowar language. The residents are available for hire as porters and tourist guides and will lead trekkers part way up the mountain, but there is a point beyond which they will not go.It is believed the origin of the name Tirich Mir is "King of Tirich" as Tirich is the name of a side valley of the Mulkhow valley of Chitral which leads up to Tirich Mir. An alternative etymology derives its name from the Wakhi language. In Wakhi "trich" means shadow or darkness and "mir" means king so Tirich Mir means king of darkness. It could have got this name as it causes long shadows on the Wakhan side of its face.Tirich is the coldest weather experiencing an altitude-influenced subarctic climate. There is low oxygen in this area due to high elevation. Winters are cold with average lows around −22 °C (−10 °F), and as low as −35 °C at the height of winter, which lasts from mid-October to mid-May. Summers start in June and go on up till early September, with average temperatures near 15 °C (60 °F) and little precipitation.

It drains part of the Sierra Nevada range along the California-Nevada border in the watershed of Walker Lake in the Great Basin.It rises from snowmelt in the Sierras of northwestern Mono County, north of Yosemite National Park approximately SSW of Walker in the Emigrant Wilderness. It flows north, along the west side of the Sweetwater Mountains, emerging into the Antelope Valley, a ranching region around Walker. It flows north past Coleville and Topaz and enters southern Douglas County, Nevada southwest of Carson City. In Nevada it flows northeast, joining the East Walker River from the west 7 mi (11.3 km) south of Yerington to form the Walker River.The river is heavily used for irrigation in the ranching valleys along its lower course. Its waters are diverted along its upper course to form Topaz Lake along the California-Nevada border. It receives the Little Walker River from the south near its source in the mountains.U.S. Highway 395 passes through the West Walker River Valley, connecting it via Devil's Gate Pass to the East Walker River; Sonora Pass and Monitor Pass lead from the valley into the Sierra Nevada and the Carson River valley. In January 1997 a record-setting flood along the West Walker River destroyed 10 miles of U.S. 395. This section of road was rebuilt in 6 months. The silt carried by the river settled in Topaz Lake, hurting the trout population there.

  <page name="Jackson Lake">Jackson Lake is in Grand Teton National Park in northwestern Wyoming. This natural lake was enlarged by the construction of the Jackson Lake Dam, which was originally built in 1911, enlarged in 1916 and rebuilt by 1989. The top of the lake is utilized by farmers in Idaho for irrigation purposes. The lake is the remnant of large glacial gouging from the neighboring Teton Range to the west and the Yellowstone Plateau to the north. The lake is primarily fed by the Snake River, which flows in from the north, and empties at Jackson Lake Dam. Jackson Lake is one of the largest high altitude lakes in the United States, at an elevation of above sea level. The lake is up to long, wide and deep. The water of the lake averages below , even during the summer.Numerous species of fish inhabit the lake including nonnative brown and lake trout and the native Snake River fine-spotted cutthroat trout and mountain whitefish.There are over 15 islands in the lake, including the largest, Elk Island, and Donoho Point.John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Memorial Parkway is located near the northern end of Jackson Lake and extends to the south entrance of Yellowstone National Park. This roadway combines with the roads in Grand Teton National Park that follow the eastern side of the lake, and provides access for boating and fishing. There are several marinas and lodges along the eastern shore such as Leeks marina, Colter Bay Village, Jackson Lake Lodge and Signal Mountain Lodge. All of these except Jackson Lake Lodge have boat access points and ramps. The western shore of Jackson Lake is primitive, with only hiking trails and a handful of primitive campground spots.

  <page name="Mount Umunhum">Mount Umunhum (Ohlone, meaning "resting place of the hummingbird") is the fourth-highest peak in California's Santa Cruz Mountains (after Loma Prieta, Crystal Peak, and Mt. Chual). The mountain is situated in Santa Clara County, south of San Jose. It is sometimes referred to as Mount Um by locals. Most of the mountain is within the Sierra Azul Open Space Preserve.The mountain is topped by a five-story concrete radar tower, known locally as "the Cube" or "the Box". The tower was part of Almaden Air Force Station, a radar surveillance post which operated from 1958 to 1980. The Cube, which housed an 85.5-ton AN/FPS-24 radar, was completed in 1962 and used to watch for hostile aircraft during the Cold War.The summit is closed to the public due to hazardous materials and unsafe, partially demolished structures from the former Air Force station. Plans are underway to clean it up and restore it for public use. The demolition of the cube was considered, but in May 2016, the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors listed it on the County Heritage Resource Inventory, giving it official historic status and protecting it from demolition. In summer 2017, a mountain biking and hiking trail to the summit will be opened, once facilities at the summit have been completed. It will be a spur of the Bay Area Ridge Trail.The mountain is also the site of the Bay Area NEXRAD weather radar. The high elevation is necessary for line of sight in the region's varied terrain, but it also limits the ability to detect storms with bases lower in the atmosphere.

  <page name="Mokolea Rock">Mōkōlea Rock is an islet in Kailua Bay along the windward coast of Oahu in Hawaii and located east of Marine Corps Base Hawaii (MCBH). Like most of the small islets off the coastline of a major island in the Hawaiian Islands, Mōkōlea is a State Bird Sanctuary containing many types of birds. Access to the islet requires a permit, and is only allowed to people involved in protecting the islet's fauna. The islet is more commonly known to local residents as "Birdshit Island", "Birdshit", or simply "Bird" because its black lava rock surface is heavily coated with bird droppings.There is no vegetation on the islet, which is actually three connected outcroppings, the highest of which is no more than 25' above mean sea level. All three consist of barren, jagged lava. Mokolea is part of the windward rim of the Kawainui volcanic caldera. About 300 feet from this outcropping on the side facing Kailua beach a shelf juts up from deep water to a depth of 25-30'. The shelf is a moderately interesting spot for scuba diving, although much of the time the area is rough, and anchoring a boat is difficult.Mokolea has been described as a shore dive by some, but it should not be attempted from the shore due to strong currents and the distance between the dive spot and Kailua beach.

Train services are provided by Northern.The station was opened by the Manchester and Leeds Railway on 1 January 1850.The railway station is in South Yorkshire but West Yorkshire Metro tickets are also valid to and from this station. The reason for this is that the West-South Yorkshire boundary historically ran between the village and its main source of employment, Woolley Colliery.The car park at the station was recently reported by the local police force as having the highest incidence of vehicle break-ins in the Barnsley area, but the installation of CCTV is hoped to address this problem.The station is unstaffed and no longer has any permanent buildings aside from standard waiting shelters on each side (the old buildings were demolished after the station lost its staffing in 1970). No ticket machine is provided, so tickets must be bought in advance or on the train. Timetable posters and digital display screens provide train running information and there is step-free access to both platforms.There is an hourly service to via and northbound and to via Barnsley southbound. The service is two-hourly in each direction on Sundays.

  <page name="Skookumchuck River">The Skookumchuck River is a long river located in southwest Washington, United States. It is a tributary of the Chehalis River and thence to the Pacific Ocean. The Skookumchuck Dam was built in 1970, creating the Skookumchuck Reservoir. The dam provides water supply for the 1400-megawatt Centralia Steam Electric Plant and supplements flows for fish resources. The river begins with several tributaries in the Snoqualmie National Forest in the foothills of the Cascade Mountains, and flows west past the town of Bucoda, Washington to its confluence with the Chehalis River near Centralia, Washington.The name of the river derives from Chinook Jargon: In this context, "rapids". The word "skookum" means "strong", and "chuck" means "water".

  <page name="Dosewallips River">The Dosewallips River (""doh-si-wall'-ips"") is a river situated on the Olympic Peninsula in the U.S. state of Washington. It rises near Mount Anderson in the Olympic Mountains within Olympic National Park and drains to Hood Canal and thence to the Pacific Ocean.The river originates in two forks, which join about five miles from the headwaters. The National Park Service maintains trails and campsites along both forks, including one at the fork itself. The road leading to the trailhead was washed out in January 2002, and the ranger station near the trailhead has been abandoned.The entire estuary of the Dosewallips is within Dosewallips State Park and ongoing restoration efforts led by Wild Fish Conservancy, the Port Gamble S'Kalallam Tribe, and the Hood Canal Coordinating Council are intended to improve salmon habitat through the reconnection of the river to its historical floodplain.The name Dosewallips comes from a Twana Indian myth about a man named Dos-wail-opsh who was turned into a mountain at the river's source. There are also several Klallam legends about the "Great Changer", Doquebatl, who transformed a mythical Klallam chief into a mountain at the headwaters of the Dosewallips River. In another story Doquebatl changed a woman into Mount Rainier and her son into Little Tahoma.In 1923, the Washington State Department of Highways built a steel truss bridge over the river near its mouth in Brinnon to carry U.S. Route 101.In 1982, the Jefferson County Public Utility District proposed the construction of a 10.4-megawatt hydroelectric dam on the river near the Elkhorn Campground. Controversy over the dam project led to a dispute between the PUD and the Washington Department of Ecology that was settled in the United States Supreme Court case "PUD No. 1 of Jefferson County v. Washington Department of Ecology" in 1994.

  <page name="Dungeness Spit">Dungeness Spit is a long sand spit jutting out from the northern edge of the Olympic Peninsula in northeastern Clallam County, Washington, USA, into the Strait of Juan de Fuca. It is the longest natural sand spit in the United States. The body of water it encloses is called Dungeness Bay. The Dungeness Spit is entirely within the Dungeness National Wildlife Refuge and home of the New Dungeness Lighthouse. Its land area, according to the United States Census Bureau, is 1,271,454 square meters (0.4909 sq mi, or 314.18 acres). The lighthouse once was run by United States Coast Guard, but in 1976 the agency installed an automatic light. Since 1994 the lighthouse has been staffed and maintained by the volunteer "New Dungeness Light Station Association". The spit is open to the public year around.The spit was first recorded by Europeans during the Spanish 1790 Quimper expedition. British explorer George Vancouver named the landform in 1792, writing "The low sandy point of land, which from its great resemblance to Dungeness in the British Channel, I called New Dungeness." He named it after the Dungeness headland in England.In December 2001 a heavy winter storm forced water over the spit. The next morning the spit was split in three places, and vehicles supplying the lighthouse were not able to traverse the spit for about a month.

  <page name="Huahine">Huahine is an island located among the Society Islands, in French Polynesia, an overseas territory of France in the Pacific Ocean. It is part of the Leeward Islands group "(Îles sous le Vent)." The island has a population of about 6,300.Huahine measures in length, with a maximum width of . It is made up of two main islands surrounded by a fringing coral reef with several islets, or "motu." Huahine Nui (Big Huahine) lies to the north and Huahine Iti (Little Huahine) to the south. The two islands are separated by a few hundred yards of water and joined by a sandspit at low tide. A small bridge was built to connect Huahine Nui and Huahine Iti.In the northwest of Huahine Nui lies a brackish lake known as Lac Fauna Nui (Lac Maeva). This lake is all that remains of the ancient atoll lagoon. Air transportation is available via Huahine airport, located on the northern shore of Huahine Nui.Administratively Huahine is a commune (municipality) part of the administrative subdivision of the Leeward Islands. Huahine consists of the following associated communes:The administrative centre of the commune is the settlement of Fare, on Huahine Nui.One of the famous attractions on Huahine is a bridge that crosses over a stream with 0.9 m - 1.8 m long eels. These eels are deemed sacred by the locals, by local mythology. While viewing these slithering creatures, tourists can buy a can of mackerel and feed the eels. The Fa'ahia archaeological site in the north of the island has revealed subfossil remains of several species of extinct birds exterminated by the earliest Polynesian colonists of the island.

  <page name="Nash Mills">Nash Mills is a civil parish within Hemel Hempstead and Dacorum Borough Council on the northern side of the Grand Union Canal, formerly the River Gade, and in the southernmost corner of Hemel Hempstead. It takes its name from the mill owned by John Dickinson in the 19th century (Nash Mill).Part of its area was reassigned in the 1980s from Three Rivers District Council &amp; Abbots Langley Civil Parish. The borough council ward extends beyond the parish boundary.A corn-mill in the area was recorded in the Domesday Book in the 11th century; it subsequently belonged, in the Middle Ages, to the Abbey of St Albans. The mill had been converted to papermaking in the late 18th century and subsequently purchased in 1811 by John Dickinson and George LongmanNash Mill was renowned for its production of tough thin paper for Samuel Bagster's "Pocket Reference Bible". A major fire in 1813 was a setback, but the insurance enabled redevelopment for large scale production. After an experiment in 1887, fine rag paper was produced on electrically driven machines: a successful innovation at Nash Mill.In 1989, Nash Mill was sold to the international Sappi Group and continued to make paper until 2006, when it was closed down and sold. Redevelopment plans for housing were publicised in September 2007. By late 2010, the Mill site had been largely cleared, leaving the mill house, Stephenson's Cottage and the war memorial.John Dickinson had Nash Mills School built in 1847.

It drains part of the Northern Oregon Coast Range northwest of Portland, originating on the east side of the mountains and flowing in a loop around the north end of the range near the mouth of the Columbia River. Its watershed of includes an important timber-producing region of Oregon that was the site of the Tillamook Burn. In its upper reaches it flows through a long narrow valley of small mountain communities but is unpopulated along most of its lower reaches inland from the coast.It rises in the northeast corner of Tillamook County, in the Tillamook State Forest. It initially flows northeast, across the northwest corner of Washington County and into western Columbia County, past Vernonia where it receives Rock Creek and Pittsburg. At Pittsburg, it looks to the northwest and west into Clatsop County, then flows southwest back into northern Tillamook County. It enters Nehalem Bay on the Pacific in an estuary at Nehalem, about west-northwest of Portland. Near its mouth on the Pacific, the river passes under U.S. Route 101.It receives the Salmonberry River from the east in northern Tillamook County. It also receives the North Fork Nehalem River from the north about northwest of Nehalem, just before entering Nehalem Bay.In 2007, a major storm caused the Salmonberry Bridge (located at ) to collapse. The bridge was rebuilt and opened to traffic on May 14, 2012.

  <page name="Salmonberry River">The Salmonberry River is a tributary of the Nehalem River, about long, in northwest Oregon in the United States. It drains a remote unpopulated area of the Northern Oregon Coast Range in the Tillamook State Forest about west-northwest of Portland. The river runs through part of the region devastated between 1933 and 1951 by a series of wildfires known as the Tillamook Burn.It rises in northeastern Tillamook County, near its border with Washington County, and flows west-northwest through the mountains, joining the Nehalem from the southeast about northeast of the city of Nehalem.The river's name comes from the salmonberry plant, "Rubus spectabilis".An excursion railway and dinner train, the Oregon Coast Scenic Railroad (OCSR), travels up the Nehalem River canyon from Wheeler to the mouth of the Salmonberry. The train to the Salmonberry is part of an excursion-train network operated by the OCSR, a non-profit organization run by volunteers, on track formerly used by the Southern Pacific Railroad and the Port of Tillamook Bay Railroad. The railway track continues up the Salmonberry for , but flooding and erosion damaged it so severely that it was closed in 2007.The Wild Salmon Center and other conservation groups concerned about salmon and steelhead runs on the Nehalem and the Salmonberry prefer that the track along the Salmonberry remain closed. Of particular concern are landslides and herbicide spraying along the railway tracks in the river's riparian zones. Both kinds of incursion can harm fish and incubating fish eggs.

Għarb was created as a parish in 1679, a move which gave impetus for the building of a new, baroque parish church. Built between 1699 and 1729, it has an elegant façade which has been compared with Francesco Borromini's Church of Saint Agnes in Piazza Navona, Rome. The village square, so quintessentially Gozitan, has become the view on many a postcard. On the square is a folklore museum housing all sorts of memorabilia retelling the Islands' rural history. Għarb lies in some of Gozo's most scenic countryside, particularly at Dbieġi, the highest hill on the Island. Also at Dbieġi is a centre for Gozitan crafts. Within the limits of Għarb is the Chapel of San Dimitri. According to legend, the first chapel was built on the cliff side by a woman whose son was freed from captivity by St. Demetrius. Also nearby is the Basilica ta' Pinu, Malta's pre-eminent shrine to the Virgin Mary. It was on this spot in 1883, that a local woman heard the voice of the Virgin. The parish church is dedicated to the visitation of Saint Mary to her cousin Saint Elizabeth. The late Karmni Grima and Frenċ tal-Għarb are two of its most renowned villagers.

The municipality had a population of 9,491 (2004-12-31) and covered an area of 357.31 km² (excluding sea) of which 0.52 km² was inland water. The population density was 26.60 inhabitants per km².The municipality was unilingually Finnish.Halikko (once called Rikala) was already in the Iron age an important trade and meeting place on the Finnish coast. E.g. the vikings sailed to the coast back then to trade. There are several Iron Age treasures found in Halikko.Manors came to Halikko at the 12th century. First the Åminne Manor, then Vuorentaka and Wiurila. In the middle of 17th century church and state wanted to separate from each other in Finland and in the 1865 the municipality of Halikko is formed. August Armfelt, the Graf of Wiurila was the first City manager.In 1932 Halikko had to give areas to Salo and in the 1967 the municipality of Angelniemi was merged with Halikko.On January 1, 2009 Halikko ceased to exist as it was attached to the City of Salo. The territory of the former Halikko thus changed status from rural to urban.The name "Halikko" is mentioned for the first time in 1313. One theory is that the name derives from the Germanic name "Halicho" or "Halik".

It drains a scenic area of the eastern San Juan Mountains west of the San Luis Valley.It rises from snowmelt along the continental divide west of Conejos Peak in western Conejos County, approximately northeast of Pagosa Springs. It flows briefly northeast, through Platoro Reservoir, then southeast through the Rio Grande National Forest, then east along the New Mexico border through a scenic canyon. It enters the southwestern corner of the San Luis Valley from the west near Conejos and joins the Rio Grande from the west approximately 15 mi (24 km) southeast of Alamosa. It is impounded at Platoro Reservoir for flood control and to manage irrigation in the San Luis Valley, as part of the San Luis Valley Project of the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation.The river is wide and shallow along much of its course. It descends steeply in several areas, including at Pinnacle Canyon, a popular destination for whitewater rafting.Off limits to white settlement during the New Spain years, the river was the site of early land grants to settlers from the government of Mexico in the 1830s. The first settlement of 50 families along the river, in the Guadalupe Grant in 1833, was destroyed in an attack by Native Americans. José Jacques established the first white settlement on the river in 1851. The town of Conejos was founded in the 1854 by Lafayette Head, who later became the first lieutenant governor of Colorado.

  <page name="Dellen">Dellen is a lake system in the province of Hälsingland, Sweden. It consists of two lakes, "Northern Dellen" and "Southern Dellen", appreciated among fly-fishermen for their distinct population of brown trout.Southern Dellen has a surface area of 52 km² and a water volume of 1,226 million m³.Northern Dellen has an area of 82 km² and a water volume of 1,489 million m³.The two lakes are only united by a short channel, and it is therefore disputed whether they should be counted as one or two lakes. If counted together, it would have a total area of 130 km², making it the 18th largest Swedish lake.The vaguely circular lake system was formed by an impact crater 89 million years ago, placing the impact in the Late Cretaceous. The resulting impact crater measures about 19 kilometers in diameter. It has resulted in the area containing the rock Dellenite (a rock intermediate in composition between Rhyolite and Dacite), which has become the provincial rock.Asteroid 7704 Dellen was named after it.An installation of the Sweden Solar System representing Pluto and Charon lies near the southern lake; the pillars holding the model objects are made of dellenite.

  <page name="Holleford crater">Holleford Crater is a meteorite crater near the community of Holleford, part of South Frontenac, Ontario, Canada. It is in diameter and the age is estimated to be 550 ± 100 million years (Ediacaran or Cambrian). Although there is a surface depression over the area, the crater itself is not exposed at the surface.Holleford Crater was discovered in the 1950s during analysis of aerial photographs under the direction of Carlyle S. Beals of the Dominion Observatory in Ottawa. In the late 1950s, the Geological Survey of Canada conducted a series of four geophysical studies: magnetic observations, seismic studies, gravity studies, and a diamond drilling program. The seismic and gravity studies and the drilling all produced data consistent with the impact theory. The drill core revealed breccia and similar materials at predicted depths. The studies concluded that an ancient meteorite impact crater is present in the Precambrian bedrock below the surface. The meteorite was estimated to be approximately in diameter and to have impacted at approximately .Holleford Crater is located on the Babcook Family Homestead Farm properties (including the original Babcook Homestead Farm, established 1803, owned by the family of the late Frederick and Jean Babcook, at Hartington, Ontario (about 1/2 hour north of Kingston Ontario)).Starting in the 1960s, the site has been visited frequently by geology students from Queen's University, at Kingston. In the 1970s, as a result of efforts by the late Frederick Babcook, an official commemorative plaque was erected along the road beside the Babcook Homestead Farm by the Province of Ontario. Queen's University's Miller Hall Museum of Geology maintains a display dedicated to the Holleford Meteorite Crater.

  <page name="Karikkoselkä">Karikkoselkä is a lake formed in an impact crater in Petäjävesi, Finland. Karikkoselkä is located approximately 30 km east from the centre of Keurusselkä, a much older and larger impact crater. Most lakes in the region are elongated in northwest-southeast direction due to glaciation, but Karikkoselkä is strikingly round.Many shatter cones, rock formations that form under the extreme pressures of impact, have been found around the lake. Further evidence comes from aeromagnetic maps, which show a clear magnetic anomaly in the impact crater area. In addition, samples collected from deep drillings into the lake bottom confirm the impact origin of the structure.The crater is the smallest identified in Finland, 1.4 km diameter and 150 m deep. Due to sediments the lake has a maximum depth of 26m which is unusually deep for a lake in the region. Karikkoselkä is estimated to be between 230 Ma and 450 Ma (million years old), most likely near 240 Ma (Triassic or earlier). Some sources give an unreasonably young age of 1.88 Ma, which is likely a misquotation – the discovery paper mentions that the bedrock in the region (known as the Central Finland Granite Complex) formed about 1.88 Ga (thousand million years ago), in the late Paleoproterozoic era.There is evidence of a neolithic settlement on the southern shore of the lake. According to a plate erected there no excavations have yet been conducted and the age of the settlement remains unknown.

Kuukkarinselkä is the third deepest lake in Finland measuring in the deepest point.In 2001, shatter cones were found in Kuukkarinselkä making it the 6th known impact crater in Finland. The crater, usually referred as Suvasvesi North crater, is located in the center of Kuukkarinselkä and measures about in diameter. Its age is estimated to be about 85 Ma but the Earth Impact Database (EID) gives a broader span of less than 1000 Ma.Haapaselkä resembles the northern counterpart and it was also suspected to be an impact crater. It has recently been confirmed and is usually referred as Suvasvesi South crater. It is similar in size, and the age of the crater is estimated to be older than 700 Ma (probably about 710–720 Ma) based on argon-argon dating of impact melt rocks found near the southeastern shore of Lake Haapaselkä but EID gives it as around 250 Ma.

It is in the Ludlow parliamentary constituency and the West Midlands European parliament constituency.Hampton Loade station, on the preserved Severn Valley Railway, is actually located on the Hampton side of the river.There is an unusual bridge close to Hampton Loade: a small private roadway is suspended below two large waterpipe arches.The village is also home to a satellite navigation error where the ferry is listed as a car ferry on certain sat-nav systems. A number of motorists using sat-nav units were misled by the error and drove off the jetty and into the river. Although there are now road signs in place warning of the error on approaching the village.On the night of 19 June 2007, the village of Hampton on the west bank suffered major damage as a result of a severe rainstorm. The one and only road into the village was washed away (BBC photo), and large sections of nearby Severn Valley Railway track subsided.

  <page name="Starkenburg">Starkenburg is an historical region in the State of Hesse, Germany, comprising the area south of the Main River and east of the Rhine, around the regional capital Darmstadt.The region is named after Starkenburg Castle, above Heppenheim on the historic Bergstraße Route. Beside the cities of Darmstadt and Offenbach, it consists of the modern districts ("kreise"):The area comprises about , roughly equivalent to the German state of Saarland.Starkenburg Castle was erected about 1065 to protect the estates around Lorsch Abbey, which itself were held by the Prince-Archbishopric of Mainz from the 13th century onwards. Upon the German mediatisation of 1803, the southern territories of the Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt—including the former Mainz lands on the Bergstraße—were incorporated into the newly established Principality (from 1816: Province) of Starkenburg. Elevated to the Grand Duchy of Hesse in 1806, the possessions in Starkenburg, as well as in the provinces of Upper Hesse in the north and Rhenish Hesse in the west were confirmed by resolution of the 1815 Vienna Congress.From 1832 the administration was subdivided into seven districts ("kreise"):both districts were merged into Bergstraße in 1938With the establishment of the present State of Hesse, Wimpfen and Steinbach were separated from the Starkenburg region; in turn, the Bischofsheim and Ginsheim-Gustavsburg quarters of the City of Mainz, located east of the Rhine River, passed to the Groß-Gerau district. A former administrative union of the Strakenburg districts was dissolved in 2007.Today the Starkenburg Economic Development Agency run in cooperation with the Darmstadt chamber of commerce as a registered association coordinates the efforts of the government units in marketing the region to technology companies. Among the main issues are the development within the Frankfurt Rhine-Main metropolitan area and the construction of the Frankfurt–Mannheim high-speed railway.

It flows west-northwest descending through Kawailoa Gulch, then empties into the eastern end of Waialua Bay at Hale'iwa. It encompasses a watershed of approximately and a 100-year peak discharge of 16,200 ft/s (459 m³/s).Archaeological evidence indicates that the valley of the river near its mouth was the site of ancient Hawaiian villages. The river valley was abandoned but was later repopulated in the early 19th century, partly as the result of a policy by King Kamehameha I to grow food to support his military expeditions. The policy included the development of irrigated terraces. In 1832 U.S. Protestant missionaries John Emerson and his wife Ursula Sophia circumnavigated Oahu and put in at the mouth of the river, located at . At the village of Hale'iwa (from "hale" (home) of the "iwa" (frigate bird)), they were welcomed by Chief Laanui and established the Liliuokalani Church in the village.In the later 19th century the village of Haleiwa and the surrounding river valley became a popular summer vacation destination for the Hawaiian monarchs. The first hotel was built along the river by businessman Benjamin Dillingham, who also built Oahu railroad from Honolulu to the north shore in 1898.

The River Tummel begins at its eastern end. The Tay Forest Park lies along its southern shore. The wild Rannoch Moor extends to the west of the loch and used to be part of the Caledonian Forest that stretched across much of Northern Scotland. This is proven in part by the presence of Scots Pine stumps preserved in the boggy areas of the moor, and pollen records from peat cores.The loch and surrounding areas have suffered from extensive deforestation and plantation of alien species. These practices have given rise to sections of dense tree plantations alternating with deforested areas.The loch and surrounding area does, however, offer good sport fishing and walking. The small village of Kinloch Rannoch lies at the eastern end of the loch, and a crannog (an ancient artificial island) with a folly on it can be found near its western end. Loch Rannoch was also used as a fictional racetrack in the videogame TOCA Race Driver 2.

In Arabic, Am Timan means "mother of twins," although the reason for the name is not known. As the capital of the prefecture, it has the area's secondary school and a clinic, and hosts the largest market day and holiday celebrations.During the conflict period, a cotton plantation and processing plant just outside the city were destroyed.The city's sand airport was upgraded by the French Foreign Legion in 1971 to allow military air transports to supply the anti-rebel effort. At the time, the only practical way in or out of the city was by air.Since the dry season lasts for about seven months of the year, water becomes a problem as the dry season progresses. Aquifers are accessed by digging deeper and deeper into the bed of the Bahr Salamat (river).

It is situated on the south edge of the Carse of Stirling, at the foot of the Gargunnock Hills, part of the Campsie Fells.Several small burns flow down from the Gargunnock HillsThe last naturally suitable crossing point on the Forth before reaching Stirling Bridge is situated just outside Gargunnock. This, coupled with the land condition and drainage around the feet or the Gargunnock hills, made Gargunnock the ideal location to build a farming settlement.During the occupation of Scotland, the English posted a garrison in the Peel tower on the outskirts of the village to protect this important ferry. It is believed that William Wallace brought his army through Gargunnock (called "Gargowans" at the time), setting up fort on the Kier Hill, to take control of this part of the river in advance of the Battle of Stirling Bridge. Bonnie Prince Charlie is also said to have passed through the village on his travels.More recently, during the nineteenth century Gargunnock was famous for its fine oak-spale baskets, until intensive deforestation removed the raw materials necessary for this trade and the industry moved to Loch Lomond.Nowadays, the village has a very lively community with a busy school, Gargunnock Primary.The majority of pupils from Gargunnock Primary continue their secondary education at the nearby Stirling High School, with others attending Balfron High School.

  <page name="City Bell">City Bell is a neighborhood located in La Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina. It is located some 10 kilometers from the city center. It forms part of the Greater La Plata urban agglomeration.The earliest settlement in City Bell was founded around 1900 by English immigrants led by George Bell. On July 18, 1913, Bell's heirs sold approximately 3 km² (1.1 mi²) to "Sociedad Anónima de City Bell" for the purpose of reselling the land in lots in the hope of founding a new town. The town, named in honor of its founder, George Bell, was authorized by the Provincial Legislature on May 10, 1914, and the City Bell station of the Buenos Aires Great Southern Railway was completed that year. The planned community grew more slowly than planned, however, and much of the grounds were used to some extent for farming. Finally, a small group of people settled down, and as the town started to grow larger, amenities were developed such as the local electric utility (1922), and a new, larger train station (1925).City Bell was chosen as the site of the Argentine Army's Communications Battalion 601 in 1944. Situated between Buenos Aires and La Plata along the former National Route 1 ("Camino Centenario"), its recreational facilities include the 200 ha (500 ac) Municipal Ecological Park, the City Bell Athletic Club (1926), which since the 1960s hosts the Regional Folklore Festival, the Teatro de Cámara, the City Bell Golf and Equestrian Clubs, the Gauguin Art Gallery (1984), and the City Bell Cultural Center (1997).

  <page name="Acarape">Acarape is a municipality in the north region of the state of Ceará, Brazil.One can attribute the existence of Acarape as simply an urban extension of the city of Redenção given that only 3 km separate the two cities.Initially the location of today's Acarape was called Calaboca which was part of the city of Redenção. When the slaves were freed in Brazil, the people of the very modest location of Calaboca decided to play homage to their origins, thus changing the name to Acarape which means "from the Acarás".Before the change above, Calaboca benefited from rail track linking Fortaleza to Baturité and the establishment of a rail station in Calaboca on October 26, 1879.Being part of a major rail route served as an incentive for small merchants to open stores in Calaboca. The population grew and on April 16, 1987 the location became a municipality with the name of Acarape.Acarape is also used by the population as a reference to city water. If one person says to be drinking water from Acarape, this person is saying that the water is tap water. This is the case, because one of the largest dams in the state of Ceará is the Acarape do Meio Dam at Redenção.

  <page name="Balzan">Balzan () is small town in the Central Region of Malta, one of the so-called three villages, together with Attard and Lija. The village originally consisted of a group of small dwellings and farms but eventually grew, becoming a parish in the 17th century. As of March 2014 the town has 3,958 inhabitants.In Malta, many village names are identical to certain family names, as in Attard and Lija. It is believed by some, therefore, that the village inherited its name from a family whose family name was "Balzan".Balsan (Balzan) literally means "tax collector" or "contributions collector". The tax collector must have been from the same parish, at the time forming part of Birkirkara.The parish church, built in the mid-17th century, is dedicated to the Annunciation of Our Lady. The church is built in the form of a Latin cross, has one belfry and an elegant dome that can be seen from all around the village. The church is built on a Tuscan style from the outside and Doric on the inside. The statue used in the village feast celebrated on the 2nd week of July, is carved in wood by Salvatore Dimech (is-sarc) and shows our lady and Gabriel the Archangel. The parish also celebrates the feast of St. Valentine, which gave the name to the village radio station, "Radio Valentine", which closed down officially in 2006.As with Attard and Lija, Balzan is a sought after location and popular with the middle and upper middle classes. The population has increased due to large-scale development taking place, largely in the form of apartment blocks replacing villas and their gardens. However, this is mainly occurring on the outskirts of the village, and not the historic centre. The majority of Balzan is an Urban Conservation Area.

  <page name="East India DLR station">East India is a station on Docklands Light Railway (DLR) in Leamouth in Greater London, England The station is situated in the East End of London that takes its name from the nearby former East India Docks of the Port of London, where ships trading with the Indian subcontinent used to dock.It is on the Beckton and Woolwich Arsenal branches of the DLR, and is in Travelcard Zones 2 and 3. It opened, with the Beckton Branch, on 28 March 1994.The historic Greenwich Prime Meridian crosses the DLR at the eastern end of the platforms, which is marked by an illuminated blue line underneath the tracks at street level. The modern IERS Reference Meridian used by GPS crosses the tracks approximately 117 metres further east between Neutron Tower and Switch House, but is unmarked.East India station was originally to be named "Brunswick Wharf" and this name was shown on the 1994 'all projections' map. 'Brunswick' is now a code destination used to indicate that a train in the depot has been cleaned. In February 2001 an episode of the ITV series "The Bill" featured DLR trains with 'Brunswick' as a dummy destination for filming purposes.

  <page name="Brent Cross tube station">Brent Cross is a London Underground station located on Highfield Avenue in the Golders Green area of north west London. The station is a Grade II listed building.The station is on the Edgware branch of the Northern line, between Hendon Central and Golders Green stations, and in Travelcard Zone 3. The Brent Cross shopping centre is some distance away. However, the bus route 210 stops outside the station on Highfield Avenue and the bus route 232 stops near the exit of station on Heathfield Gardens.The station was designed by architect Stanley Heaps and opened as Brent, the name of the nearby river, on 19 November 1923. It was the first station of the extension of what was then known as the Hampstead &amp; Highgate Line, which was built through undeveloped rural areas to Edgware.The extension had first been planned prior to World War I when the station had been due to be called Woodstock. It was renamed from Brent to its current name on the 20 July 1976 opening of the shopping centre.Two passing loops were built at the station, not long after it opened, to allow fast trains to overtake slower ones here, but these extra tracks were removed in the 1930s. The bridges over Highfield Avenue reflect this extra width, although both north and south of the station the alignment narrows again.A planning application, registered in March 2008, for the nearby Brent Cross area would improve bus services passing the station. A turning circle for buses outside the tube station is proposed, needing the demolition of nearby housing.In early 2008, the London Group of the Campaign for Better Transport published the North and West London Light Railway Proposal (q.v.) for a rapid transit scheme through the Brent Cross site, terminating at the tube station.

In the north-western area of its territory is located the mount Cervati.Sanza's biggest day of the year is August 5; a day in which all of its patrons pay homage to their other beloved saint, La Madonna Della Neve (Mary of the Snows.) In late July, a group of men carrying the heavy statue of La Madonna on their shoulders are followed by the people of Sanza as they ascend Monte Cervati (a nearby mountain in the Cilento region)The statue is then left in the small chapel at the very top. Then several days later, Sanza's devoted people, ranging from young children, to old men and women with walking sticks, once again follow La Madonna's descent back down the mountain. After a 26 kilometer journey ranging from around 2 or 3 am, up until when the people return, all those who had come down the mountain create a procession through the tight cobblestoned streets of Sanza, singing loudly and continuing to carry La Madonna.&lt;BR&gt;

  <page name="Warcino">Warcino (former German name: Varzin) is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Kępice, within Słupsk County, Pomeranian Voivodeship, in northern Poland. It lies in Pomerania on the left bank of the Wieprza river, approximately southwest of Kępice, southwest of Słupsk, and west of the regional capital Gdańsk. The village has a population of 450.The settlement, first mentioned in a 1485 deed, was part of the Duchy of Pomerania under Duke Bogislaw X (1454-1523). Subsequently held by nobles from nearby Zitzewitz (now Sycewice, Poland), it was incorporated into Brandenburg-Prussia in 1653.In 1867 it was bought from the Blumenthal family for Otto von Bismarck by the grateful Prussian state for his services as Minister President during the Austro-Prussian War. Bismarck, though born in the Altmark of west-central Germany, had ties to Pomerania as he had spent several years of his childhood at his family's estates in Kniephof (now Konarzewo) near Naugard, and married Johanna von Puttkamer (of the Pomeranian German noble family Puttkamer) at nearby Kolziglow in 1847. Johanna died at Varzin in 1894 (preceding her husband by four years).Varzin manor remained in the possession of the Bismarck family until the end of World War II. The last family resident, Countess Sybille von Bismarck (née von Arnim), daughter-in-law of Otto von Bismarck, declined to flee and, at age 81, committed suicide when the Red Army arrived in March 1945. She was buried in a family mausoleum on the grounds, which however was destroyed in 1957. After the war, German residents of the area were expelled and the locale became the Polish Warcino. The manor house, converted into a forestry college, retained a huge depiction of Bismarck's horse, Schmetterling, on its walls.

  <page name="Sgùrr Alasdair">At 3,255 feet, Sgùrr Alasdair is the highest peak of the Black Cuillin, and the highest peak on the Isle of Skye. Like the rest of the range it is composed of gabbro, a rock with excellent grip for mountaineering. It is named for Alexander Nicolson, who made the first recorded ascent in 1873. Prior to this the mountain had been locally known as Sgurr Biorach.As with other hills of the Cuillin, a head for heights and scrambling ability are needed to attain the summit. The least technical route follows a feature known as the "Great Stone Chute", a scree gully that leads up from the corrie of Coire Lagan to a col just below the main ridge. From this col, a pleasant scramble (Grade 2 standard) up the well scratched east ridge leads to the narrow summit.Other routes require scrambling ability or rock climbing; while there are rock climbs directly up the flanks, the only other way of reaching the summit via a ridge is the south-west ridge, a Grade 3 scramble that begins up a scratched chimney which can be accessed from the summit of Sgùrr Sgumain or from Coir' a' Ghrunnda; there is also a slightly easier route from the top of this chimney directly up a shallow gully on the south face. The summit of Sgùrr Alasdair can be attained by a short detour (from Sgùrr Theàrlaich) off the main ridge by climbers undertaking the full traverse of the Cuillin ridge, or by those following the circuit of Coire Lagan.

It is 16.1 mi long, and the river flows northwards from a point approximately 1.8 mi south of the Durham line in Guilford, Connecticut into Durham and then Middlefield, meeting the Mattabesset in Middletown, about upstream of the Connecticut River. The name "Coginchaug" comes from a local Native American name for the Durham area and it was the original name for the town. It has been said to mean "The Great Swamp", and is a reference to the meadows found in the central part of town.In 2006, the Coginchaug was among Connecticut's 85 waterways cited to be of "lower quality", in view of the elevated levels of bacteria, including E. coli. Currently, efforts are being made by the Natural Resources Conservation Service of the United States Department of Agriculture to reduce the number of bacteria introduced into the river from untreated sewage, sanitary sewer overflow, agricultural runoff, leaking septic tanks, etc.The river has become a popular canoeing route. In 2006, it was considered safe for canoeing, though it is not safe for in-water activities like swimming. Flowing from Myer Huber Pond, it runs slowly through thick swamps which stretch over and are likely to be impassable except immediately after heavy rains. The main paddling route starts at Route 147 and continues downstream, north, through additional slow-moving waters and a swamp. There are many portages, including those at six dams and at Wadsworth Falls, the only major waterfall. Class II whitewater is possible before it flows into the tidal marsh of the Mattabesset River.

  <page name="Gravelly Hill">Gravelly Hill is an area of Birmingham, England.Gravelly Hill is approximately 4 miles north-east of Birmingham city centre. To the north-west is Perry Barr and to the north-east are Stockland Green, Erdington and Sutton Coldfield. Aston is to the west and Washwood Heath lies to the south. The housing in the area is mostly Victorian and pre-war with some recent developments of modern apartments. Housing in the area is popular with students (particularly those attending Aston University) given its good transport links to the main campus.The Gravelly Hill Interchange, also known as Spaghetti Junction, provides the intersection between the A38(M) Aston Expressway from the centre of Birmingham to the M6 motorway. The complex junction also supports local roads joining the two motorways. The design of the intersection was also made complex by the presence of two railway lines including a high speed electrified railway and the existence of three canals including a turning basin, and a river.There are also a number of industrial units in variable condition. One of them, Gravelly Industrial Park, is one of the city's largest industrial estates. Companies with units in the park include Carlsberg, which distributes to regional accounts and national depots.Gravelly Hill railway station is part of the Cross-City Line.Gravelly Hill is part of the Stockland Green ward of Birmingham City Council. However it was previously a ward in its own right and also formed part of the Erdington Constituency. The previous ward was occasionally won by the Conservatives, with the mother of current Conservative Councillor for Erdington Robert Alden, narrowly losing the seat in 1976 elections. His father was parliamentary candidate in 1975-79 for the area, gaining one of the largest swings in the country in 1979.

  <page name="Fratton">Fratton is a residential and formerly industrial area of Portsmouth, in Hampshire, England. It consists of mostly Victorian terraced houses, and is typical of the residential areas in the city. In the past it housed a huge railway depot, but this has mostly been dismantled now, making way for a shopping complex and the redevelopment of Portsmouth F.C.'s stadium, Fratton Park.There is also a modest shopping centre on Fratton Road, called The Bridge Centre, which is dominated by a large Asda supermarket and Various Vacant Units, and in atmosphere reflects the working class roots of the neighbourhood, with local, low-budget shops and cafes. A large Tesco Extra store opened in November 2015, next to Fratton Park.Fratton is also one of the four railway stations on Portsea Island. Due to its location as the last stop before the main Portsmouth railway station (Portsmouth &amp; Southsea), Fratton has been adopted in naval slang as a euphemism for the withdrawal method of contraception "getting off at Fratton".Goldsmith's Farm and Fratton Common were part of the original small rural village originally called Froddington, the only visible evidence of this being the presence of a public house, "The Froddington Arms" on the western side of Fratton Road. Due to developments during the Industrial age, more of the surrounding land was absorbed by Portsmouth in the 1870s and 1880s, principally by new housing developments.

  <page name="Blà Bheinn">Blà Bheinn (also known as Blaven), is a mountain on the Isle of Skye in Scotland. It is usually regarded as an outlier to the Black Cuillin. It is mainly composed of gabbro, a rock with excellent grip for mountaineers and scramblers. The name "Blà Bheinn" is thought to mean "blue mountain", from a combination of Norse and Gaelic. Whereas "blå" in Modern Norwegian means "blue", the Old Norse word "blá" could, however, also refer to the colours blue-black and black.The normal route of ascent for walkers is from the east. A path leaves the B8083 on the shores of Loch Slapin about 4 km after the village of Torrin. The path follows a burn, the "Allt na Dunachie", into the corrie of "Coire Uaigneich". From here a short steep route along the ridge leads to the summit. A small amount of scrambling is needed to reach the true top of the mountain.Alternative routes follow the south ridge, or come from the north having traversed the Clach Glas ridge which links to the Red Cuillin peaks.The view from the summit is dominated by the Black Cuillin.Blaven stands in the Strathaird Estate, owned and managed since 1994 by the John Muir Trust.Blaven is depicted in Mary Stewart's 1956 thriller novel "Wildfire at Midnight".

  <page name="Sgùrr Choinnich">Sgùrr Choinnich is a Munro in the highlands of Scotland, located in the Achnashellach Forest area between Glen Carron and Loch Monar. It is mostly a hill of steep, grassy slopes, with a narrow summit ridge that runs east/west. There are crags on the northern side of this ridge, looking down into the corrie of Coire Choinnich.From the summit there are fine views of the Coulin and Torridon peaks to the north, whilst southward lies a large expanse of wilderness around Loch Monar.The hill is often climbed along with the neighbouring Sgùrr a' Chaorachain, which lies to the east, as the pair are linked by a high bealach at the head of Coire Choinnich. The most normal route of ascent starts from the north, near Craig, a small village in Glen Carron. A good track leads up the side of the Allt a' Chonais burn, and once across the burn one possible route of ascent is the north ridge of Sgùrr a' Chaorachain. From the summit of this peak one may continue west onto the summit of Sgùrr Choinnich.From the east, a well defined ridge leads to the bealach of Bealach Bhearnais; here a stalkers track leads from the glen of Allt a' Chonais is met, thus a circular route is possible. Alternatively from Bealach Bhearnais one may choose to ascend the neighbouring peaks of Beinn Tharsuinn and Sgùrr nan Feartaig.

  <page name="Tory Channel">Tory Channel / Kura Te Au is one of the drowned valleys that form the Marlborough Sounds in New Zealand. Inter-island ferries normally use it as the principal channel between Cook Strait and the Marlborough Sounds.Tory Channel lies to the south of Arapaoa Island, separating it from the mainland. At its western end it joins the larger Queen Charlotte Sound, which it meets halfway along the latter's length. Its eastern end meets Cook Strait close to the strait's narrowest point.Tory Channel forms a substantial part of the ferry route between Wellington and Picton. Erosion attributed to the ferries, particularly the new faster ones (now discontinued), has resulted in speed restrictions.One of the two candidates for the easternmost point in the South Island (along with Cape Campbell) lies at the entrance of Tory Channel. It is called West Head.Although James Cook anchored several times nearby in Ship Cove, he did not find the channel. Tory Channel was surveyed in 1840 and named after the New Zealand Company ship "Tory", a pioneer ship that brought British colonists to Wellington. Around this time, whaling stations were already operating in Te Awaiti Bay.Between 1911 and 1964, the Perano family hunted whales from Whekenui Bay. Humpback whales were spotted from the hills at the Tory Channel entrance during their migration through Cook Strait. The Perano Whaling Station was the last whaling operation in New Zealand and closed in 1964.The name of Tory Channel was officially altered to Tory Channel / Kura Te Au in August 2014.Energy Pacifica has applied for resource consent to install up to ten underwater tidal stream turbine, each able to produce up to 1.2 MW, near the Cook Strait entrance to Tory Channel. They claim Tory Channel has tidal flows of with good bathymetry and access to the electricity network.

  <page name="Thaton">Thaton (; , ) is a town in Mon State, in southern Myanmar on the Tenasserim plains. Thaton lies along the National Highway 8 and is also connected by the National Road 85.Thaton is the Burmese name of Sadhuim in Mon, which in turn is from Sudhammapura () in Pali, after Sudharma, the moot hall of the gods.Thaton was the capital of the Thaton Kingdom, which ruled present day Lower Burma between the 9th and 11th centuries. Like the Burmans and the Thais, some modern Mons have tried to identify their ethnicity and, specifically this kingdom at Thaton, with the semi-historical kingdom of Suwarnabhumi ("The Golden Land"); today, this claim is contested by many different ethnicities in south-east Asia, and contradicted by scholars. Historical scholarship indicates that the early usage of the term (as found in the edicts of Ashoka of India, who sent Buddhist missionaries there in the 3rd century BC) indicated a location in southern India, and not in south-east Asia.In the kingdom of Dvaravati, Thaton was an important seaport on the Gulf of Martaban, for trade with India and Sri Lanka. Shin Arahan, also called Dhammadassi, a monk born in Thaton and raised and educated in Nakhon Pathom, an old capital of the Mon kingdom of Dvaravadi, now in Thailand, took Theravada Buddhism north to the Burmese kingdom of Bagan. In 1057, King Anawrahta of Bagan conquered Thaton.Silting has resulted in the coastline moving away from Thaton, which is now a sleepy town on the rail line from Bago to Mottama.

The bluffs are contained within the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Site.The bluffs stretch northwest to southeast over from the Western Bluff near the town of Mole Creek to the Millers Bluff, approximately west of Campbell Town.The tiers form an escarpment between the high, rocky, sparsely inhabited central plateau and the lower land of the Meander Valley and the northern midlands. The edge of the tiers have prominent cliffs and columns of Jurassic dolerite. The highest peak in the tiers is the Ironstone Mountain. Unlike most of the bluffs this mountain is not visible from the Meander Valley, but is south of the escarpment. The dolerite is so prominent as the older rocks that overlay them are softer and have been eroded away. In places dolerite columns have collapsed into scree slopes. Many walking tracks ascend the face of the Tiers.The peaks and bluffs of the Great Western Tiers include:

It extends for 1,530 ha, comprising 1,955 inhabitants in 623 homes, and a biospheric reserve, containing beavers and storks. The local economy is predominantly based on agriculture and tourism.From the sixth until the tenth century, a Slavic fortified settlement existed 3 km away from the modern village. The settlement was one of the main centres of the Great Moravian Empire, plausibly its capital city. Excavations, led by Josef Poulík, unearthed the remnants of twelve churches, a palace, and more than 2,500 graves (three containing African skeletons) (including a horse burial). The only still-standing church safely dated to the Great Moravian period is found in the nearby Slovak village of Kopčany. The excavation complex is nationally recognised as the Mikulčice-Valy or Mikulčice Archaeopark heritage site.The oldest written reference to the village itself dates to 1131, when the village was referred to as "Miculcici" in Medieval Latin. Both the Czech "Mikulčice" and the Latin "Miculcici" are nouns which exist only in the plural form, like "the Netherlands".

  <page name="Nyord">Nyord is a Danish island in the Baltic Sea, southeast of Zealand, just north of Møn island.Nyord covers an area of approximately 5 km², although only 1.2 km² is cultivatable moraine, while the remaining 4 km² is salt-meadow which is used for summer grazing, but is flooded during the winter.The island is reached by a narrow bridge from the larger island of Møn. The bridge was constructed in 1968 and replaced the post boat "Røret" which had been in service since 1902. The boat was not large enough for animals such as cattle or horses, which had to swim alongside the boat.Traditionally the island has been self-sufficient, relying upon farming, fishing and piloting. Prior to 1769 the island belonged to the crown, but at this time crown lands were sold off, and the islanders purchased their own island for 3903 rigsdaler. The waters around the island are sufficiently treacherous that islanders could gain a livelihood as pilots, and this became enshrined in law as both a right and duty of the islanders between 1721 and 1879. After 1879 pilots were employed directly by the government instead of earning individual fees. A number of pilots houses and a lookout were constructed when the government took over the service. Piloting ceased in 1966.The village of Nyord remains similar to its original design, with traditional thatched cottages and farm houses. It has a church, museum and small harbour. There is a restaurant "Lolles Gård" which is both a farm and a restaurant, there also is a village shop. The marshland area crossed by the bridge from the main island has one of Denmark's most important habitats for geese, ducks and other wading birds. There is an observation tower for birdwatchers to use.

  <page name="Yugawara">Yugawara is located in the far southwestern corner of the prefecture, facing Sagami Bay on the Pacific Ocean.Kanagawa PrefectureShizuoka PrefectureDuring the Kamakura period, the area around Yugawara was called "Doi County" in Sagami Province. The area was under control of the late Hōjō clan in the Sengoku period, and part of Odawara Domain during the Edo period. After the Meiji Restoration, it was divided into six villages, and initially formed part of the short-lived Ashigara Prefecture, before becoming part of Ashigarashimo District of Kanagawa Prefecture. In April 1889, four of the six villages merged to form Doi village. The remaining two villages merged to from Yoshihama village.

A planned merger of Yugawara into Odawara in 2005 was rejected by local voters in an August 8, 2004 referendum.Yugawara has many "onsen" hot spring resorts, and tourism plays a major role in the local economy. Agriculture and commercial fishing play secondary roles in the local economy.Additionally, the region is close to the region of Makuyama (幕山）offering many popular sport rock climbing routes, within easy access from Tokyo.The major part of the local population is elderly, as Yugawara is famous for resorts catering especially to the elderly. The town has three public elementary schools and one public middle school. A prefectural high school was closed in 2008, and high-school students now study in the neighboring city of Odawara. Yugawara offers little night entertainment, though it does have bowling halls, supermarkets, restaurants and pubs. The suburbs of the town provide hotels and apartments for tourists seeking to enjoy hot spring baths, either during vacations or on weekends.

According to the 2012 national census, the region had a population of 1,270,854, which was lower than the pre-census projection of 1,374,767. For 2002-2012, the region's 1.2 percent average annual population growth rate was the 26th highest in the country. It was also the fourteenth most densely populated region with 76 people per square kilometer.The boundary with Mozambique to the south is formed by the Ruvuma River. To the west, Mtwara is bordered by Ruvuma Region, to the north by Lindi Region, and to the east is the Indian Ocean.Development of the Mtwara Region has been constrained by the lack of highway and energy infrastructures. The Dar es Salaam-Kibiti-Lindi-Mtwara road has been improved by the completion of the Mkapa Bridge over the Rufiji River. Mnazi Bay gas promises to provide reliable and adequate electricity for powering industrial and commercial activities in the region.The regional commissioner of the Mtwara Region is Anatoli A. Tarimo.In 1948, the British Government formulated the "Tanganyika groundnut scheme" through the Overseas Food Corporation (OFC). The purpose was to alleviate the worldwide shortage of vegetable oils; however, inadequate research and adverse environmental conditions due to poor planning resulted in the complete and disastrous failure of the scheme. In this region the exported crop was to go through the port of Mtwara which was created for the scheme and linked to the growing areas near Nachingwea by a new railway.The region is administratively divided as five districts with Mtwara Municipal and Masasi Town having separate councils:http://www.nbs.go.tz/sensa/popu2.php

  <page name="Cape Nordkinn">Cape Nordkinn (, also called "Nordkyn") at is the northernmost point on the Nordkinn Peninsula in Finnmark county, Norway. It is notable for being the northernmost point of mainland Norway, and by extension the northernmost point of mainland Europe. The cape is located on the border of the municipalities of Gamvik and Lebesby.Cape Nordkinn is the northern tip of the fractal peninsula within the northernmost part of the Nordkinn Peninsula, about in a straight line northwest from the village of Mehamn.North Cape (more precisely Knivskjellodden) at 71°11′ 8″ N, is about further north than Cape Nordkinn, and it is branded as Europe's "official" northernmost point.In sharp contrast to North Cape with its extensive tourist infrastructure and busloads of visitors, Cape Nordkinn is a lonely but impressive place that can only be visited following at least a full-day hike from Mehamn and one day back. The terrain is sufficiently difficult for hiking, consisting largely of several kilometers long rock fields, that it is advisable to prepare for more than two days for the round trip, since it is one way. There is no actual trail, only erected poles and cairns at rather long distances apart.It is advisable not to travel in rainy weather, as the slippery stones make the terrain very difficult, with sudden fogs and associated whiteout. In fog the orientation on the highland south of the cape can be impossible without a GPS. There is mobile phone coverage in the area except on west facing slopes.The cape can also be reached by boat tours. The tourist bureau of Gamvik municipality provides tourist information. Hurtigruten ships call at Mehamn and Kjøllefjord to the southwest of the cape, providing a sighting opportunity for visitors on the way.

  <page name="Middle Mouse">Middle Mouse ( - "Patrick's island") is an uninhabited island situated 1 kilometre off the north coast of Anglesey. It is notable as the northernmost point of Wales. The island measures a maximum of 207 metres by 110 metres, with a maximum area of 3.7 acres and has a maximum altitude of 16 metres above sea level. It is one of a chain of three islands off the north of Anglesey, the others being Ynys Amlwch and Maen y Bugail.Local legend has it that St Patrick was shipwrecked there, giving rise to its Welsh name. He then swam ashore and eventually founded the nearby church of Llanbadrig in about 440 AD, believed to be the oldest Christian site in Wales.Middle Mouse is a favoured place for cormorants, guillemots and razorbills. For visiting scuba divers the attractions are steep underwater cliffs that drop away to 40 metres with abundant marine life. There is very little protection from the fierce tidal flow, so accurate timing for slack water is required.During the 19th century the island was used as a navigational aid to ships sailing into Liverpool. Any vessel that passed the island without signalling, and waiting for, a pilot was liable to incur a fine. The S.S. "Liverpool", following a collision with a ship named "Laplata", was shipwrecked near Middle Mouse in 1863. She had on board a shipment of tin ingots.In 2005, the island was put up for sale as part of a estate.

It is one of only two Corbetts on Skye.From many angles the hill resembles a perfect cone of scree, though it is linked to the rest of the Red Hills by way of a bealach, the Bealach na Sgairde (pronounced "b'ya-loch na skaar-st'ya"), meaning the pass of scree.In 1889, a Gurkha named Harkabir Tharpa scaled Glamaig in a 37 minutes; his total time for the round trip, starting and finishing at sea level in the bar of the Sligachan Inn was 55 minutes. Legend has it that he ran it in bare feet, and his record stood until the 1980s, despite being attempted by Olympians such as Chris Brasher in the 1950s.From Sligachan one route of ascent (whether running or hillwalking) is simply to head up the scree aiming for the summit - this climb is very arduous, due to the unrelenting gradient and the slipperiness of the scree. Descent may be made by way of ascent; alternatively one may continue along the Red Cuillin ridge to take in other peaks to the south.A slightly less arduous (but longer) climb approaches the mountain from its eastern end at Sconser. Climb first to the secondary summit, An Coileach (The Cockerel), then follow the whaleback ridge to the primary summit, Sgurr Mhairi (Mary's Peak). Once An Coileach is reached at , the more-or-less level ridge allows some respite from the gradient, with a gentler ascent of the final to Sgurr Mhairi.From the summit there are excellent views of both the Black Cuillin and the Isle of Raasay.

  <page name="Ghislenghien">Ghislenghien () is a small town near Ath in Hainaut province, part of the Francophone Walloon region of Belgium. It has about 3000 inhabitants.On July 30, 2004 a high-pressure natural gas pipeline operated at a pressure of 70 bar ruptured following recent third party damage. Twenty-four people died as a result and 150 survivors were hospitalised, most with severe burns.It is thought that damage to the pipeline occurred during the final stages of a car park construction project. Notice of the work had been given to the pipeline operator, Fluxys, and one of their operatives had regularly attended the site through the course of the project. Damage to the pipeline probably occurred as a mechanical soil stabiliser was driven over it or near by. This resulted in several evenly spaced (but not full depth) gouges in the steel wall of the pipeline. Two weeks after the completion of the car park gas pressure was increased in the pipeline, which then ruptured with the fault centred on a 350 mm long gouge. Other contributing factors to the accident may have been a reduced cover over the pipeline as a result of levelling, the way information was passed down the sub-contracting chain to workers and the frequency and adequacy of supervision by the pipeline operator at the site.

  <page name="Hunza River">Hunza River () is the principal river of Hunza in Gilgit–Baltistan, Azad Kashmir, Pakistan . It is formed by the confluence of the Kilik and Khunjerab "nalas" (gorges) which are fed by glaciers. It is joined by the Gilgit River and the Naltar River before it flows into the Indus River.The river cuts through the Karakoram range, flowing from north to south. The Karakoram Highway (KKH) crosses the Hunza River near Hunza and Nagar valleys.The river is dammed for part of its route.In January 2010, the Attabad landslide disaster in January 2010 completely blocked the Hunza Valley. A new lake — now called the Attabad Lake or Gojal Lake — which extends 30 kilometers and rose to a depth of 400 feet, was formed as the Hunza River backed-up. The landslide completely covered sections of the Karakoram Highway.

  <page name="Duck Key">Duck Key is an island in Monroe County, Florida, United States, in the middle Florida Keys. It is part of the Duck Key, Florida census-designated place. The CDP also includes the neighboring island of Conch Key.Duck Key is located oceanside of U.S. 1 (or the Overseas Highway), at approximately mile marker 61, between Conch Key and Grassy Key at .The key was the site of a salt manufacturing operation in the 1820s &amp; 1830s. Occupation of the island ceased after the Labor Day Hurricane of 1935 and did not resume until the key was connected to the highway by a causeway in 1953. J.W. Norie, in his Piloting Directions for the Gulf of Florida, The Bahama Bank &amp; Islands (1828) states: "Duck Key - Some two miles (3 km) long, low, rocky, &amp; covered with mangroves; some small patches of good land with a little timber. This island formerly saltworks but they were transferred latterly to Key West, owned by Mr. Howe, who is also possessor of this Key." Hawk's Cay Resort is currently located here, and the island is sometimes known by that name. Noted Michigan Senate leader, Emil Lockwood, retired in Duck Key, where he served in many civic and political capacities until his death in 2002.

  <page name="Marangu">Marangu is a town located in Kilimanjaro Region.Before Independence in 1961, the town of Marangu used to be the headquarters of the Vunjo district led by Chief (Mangi Mwitori) Petro Itosi Marealle and Paramount Chief (Mangi Mkuu) Thomas Marealle, installed in 1951, who lived in Moshi itself.. The four and half day Marangu Route climb is considered the least arduous. It is believed that the first man in history to have climbed Kibo peak on Kilimanjaro was Kinyala Johannes Lauwo (1871–1996) of Ashira Marangu.The word "Marangu" means a place with too many water streams. It is one of the most popular places in Tanzania. One of the proverbs of Chagga is "Ulamine kilahu ulyemkiwoa" (not from the Vunjo dialect) which means do not despise something/somebody from which you once received support.Many Marangu residents are farmers growing bananas, vegetables and coffee. However, the biggest source of income is tourism. The Marangu route is the most popular hiking route in Africa. The town has world class hotels like Babylon Lodge, hosting local and international guests wanting to climb Mount Kilimanjaro. New Marangu residents are young men from all over Tanzania looking to work in the tourism industry as porters and guides.Marangu is home to The Marangu Teacher Training College and Ashira Girls High School and many other schools which provides education to not only marangu residents but to other residence from different places around Tanzania country

  <page name="Toketee Falls">Toketee Falls is a waterfall in Douglas County, Oregon, United States, on the North Umpqua River at its confluence with the Clearwater River. It is located approximately east of Roseburg near Oregon Route 138."Toketee" (pronounced TOKE-uh-tee), is a Chinook Jargon word meaning "pretty" or "graceful". The falls was officially named by a United States Board on Geographic Names decision in 1916, over alternate names Ireland Falls and Toketie Falls.Carved from ancient columnar basalt, Toketee Falls drops approximately in two stages.With a reliable water flow on the North Umpqua River, the falls avoids the seasonal fluctuations of other creek-fed waterfalls in Oregon.The waterfall is regulated by a dam built just upstream by PacifiCorp, which now regulates and reduces the water flow over the falls. The damming forms a reservoir called Toketee Lake. Previously the full volume of the North Umpqua River was allowed to flow over the falls, but the flow has been reduced by a penstock that utilizes the drop of the falls to generate hydroelectricity.There was a Toketee Falls, Oregon post office from 1952 to 1956 during the construction of the PacifiCorp hydroelectric plant.

  <page name="Zwin">The Zwin is a nature reserve at the North Sea coast, on the Belgian-Dutch border. It consists of the entrance area of a former tidal inlet which during the Middle Ages connected the North Sea with the ports of Sluis and Bruges inland.The Zwin inlet was formed originally by a storm that broke through the Flemish coast in 1134, creating a tidal channel that reached some 15 km inland and was also connected, through another channel, to the mouth of the Scheldt further north-east. The new waterway offered access to the sea to the inland city of Bruges, which consequently rose to become one of the foremost medieval port cities of Europe. The towns of Damme, Sluis and Sint Anna ter Muiden were also located on the Zwin. However, from the late 13th century onwards, the channel was affected by progressive silting, which ultimately caused the waterway to become unusable and cut off the harbour of Bruges from the sea.The present-day nature reserve was founded in 1952. It has an area of 1.25 square kilometres in Knokke-Heist, Belgium and 0.33 square kilometres in Sluis, Netherlands. It is famous for its large variety in salt-resistant flora, such as Sea lavender. It is also popular with bird watchers. There is a small zoo with some major domestic birds and it is one of the few places in Belgium with a population of white storks.In March 1986 it was declared a Wetland of International Importance.

  <page name="Macintyre River">The Macintyre River, a perennial river that forms part of the Border Rivers group, is part of the Barwon catchment of the Murray-Darling basin, located in the Northern Tablelands and North West Slopes regions of New South Wales, and the Southern Downs region of Queensland, Australia.Part of the course of the river marks the boundary between Queensland and New South Wales.The Macintyre River rises on the western slopes of the Great Dividing Range, west of Guyra and south of Glen Innes, and flows generally northwest and west, joined by twenty-two tributaries, including the Severn River (New South Wales) and Dumaresq River, before reaching its confluence with the Weir River to form the Barwon River, west of Goondiwindi. In 1914, the current Goondiwindi Border Bridge was opened. It replaced a timber structure which was built in 1878. The Macintyre River descends over its course; passing near the towns of Glen Innes, Inverell, Ashford, Yetman, and Boggabilla. The flow of the river is impounded by Boggabilla Weir.The Macintyre River, together with Pike Creek, the Mole, Beardy, Severn (Queensland), Severn (New South Wales), and Dumaresq rivers are all part of the Border Rivers group. Originally named the Dumaresq River by Allan Cunningham. The name Macintyre was given by Cunningham to what is now known as the Dumaresq River. Peter Macintyre was the overseer at Segenhoe Station.The Macintyre River is often affected by floods and the town of Goondiwindi is protected by levee banks that can cope with a water level rise of nearly . During the 2010–2011 Queensland floods the river peaked at .Previous peaks have occurred during 1996, at and during 1976.

  <page name="Ward's Stone">Ward's Stone is the highest hill in the Forest of Bowland. Its flat top hides two trig points nearly a kilometre apart. The western trig point sits atop of large rocks, including one, the Ward's Stone, that is so large it attracts boulderers and climbers.The path from Grit Fell is difficult: crossing Cabin Flat, it weaves its way across hidden pools of stagnant water, the presence of which is betrayed by a form of red grass. White markers supposedly point out the way, but more often result in leading the walker astray. The second trig points faces the empty vastness of the eastern Forest of Bowland, with the summits of Wolfhole Crag, White Hill and the distant Ingleborough breaking the horizon. A second path approaches Ward's Stone from Tarnbrook, where limited parking is available.On the southern slope of this hill are Thorn Crag, Hell Crag and Long Crag, rocky outcroppings that are popular with climbers. Within Thorn Crag, a shallow cave system exists that leads to Hell Crag; this route was first traversed by Lancaster University Mountaineering Club.

  <page name="Parlick">Parlick (also known as Parlick Pike) is an approximately cone-shaped steep-sided hill at the extreme south of the main range of Bowland fells in Lancashire, England. Its bog-free sides make it more popular with walkers than the shallow boggy hills to its north. Paths zigzag up this hill from the south, or for the more strenuous ascent a straight path can be chosen. This hill is usually green — different from the often thorny brown to red of the northern hills. A thin neck joins Parlick onto Fair Snape Fell with well-worn paths linking the two.Regarding the origin of the name, Professor Eilert Ekwall, in his 1922 "The Place-names of Lancashire", writes:Parlick is a popular venue for foot-launched gliders, because it produces good ridge lift in an unusually wide variety of wind directions. The extensive west-facing bowl allows paraglider pilots to fly to Fair Snape Fell and beyond without leaving reliable ridge lift and as far forwards as Beacon Fell. Local pilots use this arena for club competitions, such as the 'Parlick Grid Challenge'The summit consists of little more than a cairn, leaving the walker to look at the view, south to Preston and Winter Hill near Chorley, east toward Pendle Hill, and west towards Blackpool and the Irish Sea.The boundary between the boroughs of Wyre and Ribble Valley passes very close to the summit, with half of the hill lying within each borough."Parlick Fell" is the name of a cheese made in Longridge from sheep's milk from the area.The hill and its environs are the location of the legend of the enormous Dun Cow, which was reputed to wander freely across the moorland, and to be in the habit of quenching its thirst at "Nick's Water-Pot", a well on the summit of Parlick.

  <page name="Fair Snape Fell">Fair Snape Fell is one of the larger hills in the Forest of Bowland in Lancashire, England. It occupies a position in the very south of the main range of fells, alongside and just to the north of Parlick, to which it is joined by a ridge. The main paths approach the summit from Parlick in the south, Saddle Fell in the east and Bleasdale in the valley to the west. The Saddle Fell approach is as boggy as the hills to the north. The summit is covered in grass and peat groughs. A trig point and large cairn occupy the top of the western escarpment, with the highest point being about  metres (half a mile) to the north-east.The word "snape" means "pasture", thus Fair Snape Fell means "fell of the fair (beautiful) pasture".Considerable areas of the Bowland fells were used for military training duringWorld War II and there are still unexploded bombs in some areas, including nearby Wolf Fell.

  <page name="Kelmscott">Kelmscott is a village and civil parish on the River Thames in West Oxfordshire, about east of Lechlade in neighbouring Gloucestershire. Since 2001 it has absorbed Little Faringdon, which had been a separate civil parish. The 2011 Census recorded the merged parish's population as 198.Kelmscott Manor is a Cotswold stone house, built in about 1570 during the Great Rebuilding of England and extended late in the 17th century. It was the country home of William Morris from 1871 until his death in 1896. He drew great inspiration from the unspoilt authenticity of the house's architecture and craftsmanship, and its organic relationship with its setting. Kelmscott Manor now belongs to the Society of Antiquaries of London.Morris renamed his London town house Kelmscott House after Kelmscott when he bought it in April 1879. He named his private press, which he started in 1891, Kelmscott Press.The nave of the Church of England parish church of Saint George was built in about 1190 in the transitional style between Norman and Early English, and the chancel is probably of the same date. The building has transepts that were added in about 1260. The clerestory of the nave was added in the 15th century. Many of the windows of the nave and chancel are Perpendicular Gothic additions, including the east window of the chancel. The church is a Grade II* listed building.In the churchyard is the tomb of William Morris, designed by Philip Webb. Morris featured the church in his novel "News from Nowhere", when in the final part of the book the Guest is taken there for the feast.St George's parish is now part of the Benefice of Shill Valley and Broadshire, which includes also the parishes of Alvescot, Black Bourton, Broadwell, Broughton Poggs, Filkins, Holwell, Kencot, Langford, Little Faringdon, Shilton and Westwell.

  <page name="Y Lliwedd">Y Lliwedd is a mountain, connected to Snowdon in the Snowdonia National Park, North Wales.Its summit lies 2,946 ft (898 m) above sea level.The eastern flanks are steep cliffs rising above Glaslyn and Llyn Llydaw. Y Lliwedd is the most conspicuous of the peaks for those who approach Snowdon via the Miners' and Pyg tracks. Few that summit Snowdon continue over to Y Lliwedd as the challenge of Wales' highest peak is enough, leaving Y Lliwedd quiet and peaceful even when queues are forming at the summit of Snowdon.Hikers and mountaineers often pass over Y Lliwedd when walking the Snowdon Horseshoe. The noted British climber George Mallory undertook many of his early climbs here. It was also the site of considerable training activity for the 1953 British Everest Expedition.The north face of Y Lliwedd was explored in the late 19th century and in 1909 was the subject of the first British climbing guide, "The climbs on Lliwedd" by J. M. A. Thomson and A. W. Andrews.Two subsidiary peaks of Y Lliwedd are listed as Nuttalls: Lliwedd Bach 2699 ft (818 m): and Y Lliwedd East Peak 2947 ft (893 m): .

To the south is Gabbs Valley.The Sand Springs Range was the site of Project Shoal, an underground nuclear test conducted as part of the Vela Uniform program. "Shoal" was a 12 kiloton device which was detonated below ground on October 26, 1963. As the area experienced a series of large earthquakes in 1954, seismic traces for the events could be compared to help differentiate future Soviet underground nuclear tests from earthquakes. The site is unrestricted and unmarked. No surface crater was formed, and the casual observer will find little evidence that the event ever took place.The Sand Springs Range also has several large military radar installations. These are associated with the bombing range in Fairview Valley, the electronic warfare range in Dixie Valley, and Naval Air Station Fallon.The most prominent peak in the Sand Springs Range is Big Kasock Mountain at an elevation of .

  <page name="Mokotów">Mokotów () is a "dzielnica" (borough, district) of Warsaw, the capital of Poland. Mokotów is densely populated. It is a seat to many foreign embassies and companies. Only a small part of the district is lightly industrialized ("Służewiec Przemysłowy"), while the majority is full of parks and green areas (most known is near Pole Mokotowskie Metro Station).Although the area has been populated at least since the early Middle Ages, it was not until early 1916 when Mokotów was incorporated into Warsaw. The name of the area, first appearing as the village of Mokotowo in documents from the year 1367, has unclear origins. It is hypothesised to have come from the name of a Prussian owner of the village, who called himself Mokoto or Mokot, however no exact reference to such an individual can be found in the historical records. Most of the area was urbanized in the late 1920s and 1930s. The area survived World War II and the events of the Warsaw Uprising quite well and is one of the few well-preserved areas of Warsaw nowadays. Mokotów Prison is located within the borough.The following lower-level administrative units ("osiedle") are established within Mokotow (they do not cover the whole district).Administratively defined in 1996, this district is divided into following areas:While the following subdivisions have no formal, administrative status, they are recognized in the everyday life.

  <page name="Sverdrup Islands">The Sverdrup Islands is an archipelago of the northern Queen Elizabeth Islands, in Nunavut, Canada. The islands are situated in the Arctic Ocean, west of Ellesmere Island from 77° to 81° North and 85° to 106° West.The islands are named after Norwegian explorer Otto Sverdrup, who explored and mapped them from 1898 to 1902 with the vessel "Fram", although some were previously inhabited by Inuit people. Sverdrup claimed the islands for Norway, but the Norwegian government showed no interest in pursuing the claim until 1928.

Kaffeklubben Island is approximately in length, and about across at its widest point. The highest point is about above sea level.The first recorded sighting of the island was made by the United States explorer Robert Peary in 1900; however, Kaffeklubben was not visited until 1921. It was then, when the Danish explorer Lauge Koch set foot on the island, that it received its name, after the coffee club in the University of Copenhagen Geological Museum.In 1969 a Canadian team calculated that its northernmost tip lies farther north than Cape Morris Jesup, thus claiming its record as the most northerly point on land.Since then, several gravel banks have been found to the north, most notably Oodaaq and 83-42, although there is debate as to whether such gravel banks should be considered for the record since they are rarely permanent, being regularly swallowed by the moving ice sheets, shifting, or becoming submerged in the ocean.Despite the harsh environment, vegetation grows on Kaffeklubben island – not only various mosses, liverworts, and lichens, but also flowering plants: Saxifraga oppositifolia (purple saxifrage) and Papaver radicatum (arctic poppy).

It is recorded that Çanakkale, which was also called as "Hellespontos" and "Dardanelles" in ancient times, has accommodated to many civilizations for about 3,000 years. Even the Archaic Troy (Troia) city, where was governed by Lydians and destroyed by the devastating earthquake in 2500 BC, has ruins in today. In 336 BC, Persian Empire which became the crucial power in Anatolia and was conducted by Alexander the Great that aimed to extend ancient Greece all over the world, was defeated. Also with the ruin of the Anatolian beylik of Karesi, most of the territory of Canakkale was conquered in the Ottoman era, with the assistance of the castles in remuneration for helping to Byzantine Empire, locating Gelibolu. Afterwards, the Canakkale strait was given to the Ottoman Empire.The province of Çanakkale is a notable region for viticulture and winemaking in Turkey. The region between Saros Gulf and Gelibolu on the Gallipoli peninsula is cultivated with vineyards. Wine producer "Suvla" is located in .Çanakkale province is divided into 12 districts (capital district in bold):

  <page name="Shire River">The Shire is the largest river in Malawi. The river has been known as the Shiré or Chire River. It is the only outlet of Lake Malawi and flows into the Zambezi River in Mozambique. Its length is . The upper Shire River issues from Lake Malawi and runs approximately 12 miles before it enters shallow Lake Malombe. It then drains Lake Malombe and flows south through Liwonde National Park where large concentrations of hippopotamus are common along its shores. Between the towns of Matope and Chikwawa, the middle river drops approximately 1,300 feet through a series of falls and gorges. Two hydroelectric dams have been built along the Shire northwest of Blantyre.Beyond Chikwawa, the lower river turns southeast and enters the low-lying Mozambique plain. Its largest and one of its few perennial tributaries, the Ruo River, joins the Shire near the Malawian town of Chiromo. The muddy waters pass though a large stagnant area known as the Elephant Marsh before reaching the confluence with the Zambezi River south of the town of Sena, Mozambique.In 1859, David Livingstone's Zambezi Expedition traveled up the Shire as far as Kapichira Falls in what is now the Majete Game Reserve.The river's valley is part of the East African Rift system.Application of self-organising maps and multi-layer perceptron-artificial neural networks for streamflow and water level forecasting in data-poor catchments: the case of the Lower Shire floodplain, Malawi. http://www.iwaponline.com/nh/up/nh2014168.htm

  <page name="Brielse meer">The Brielse Meer ("Lake Den Briel") is a long, narrow lake between the Dutch estuary islands of Voorne and Rozenburg in the province of South Holland.The lake takes its name from Den Briel, a town on its shore. It was formerly a Meuse branch known as Brielse Maas (Den Briel Meuse), which ran from the Botlek strait near Rotterdam into the North Sea. The first stretch, between Botlek and the former confluence with the Het Scheur branch, was alternatively known as (the last stretch of) Nieuwe Maas.When the Brielse Maas silted up in the late nineteenth century, the Nieuwe Waterweg ship canal was constructed (1872) and Het Scheur was separated from the Brielse Maas by a dam. As a precursor to the Delta Works sea barrier constructions, the Brielse Maas was closed off at both ends in 1950, becoming the Brielse Meer.

  <page name="Botlek">The Botlek originally was the name of a stretch of the Nieuwe Maas river, part of the Rhine-Meuse delta near the Dutch cities of Vlaardingen and Spijkenisse in the province of Zuid-Holland. Specifically, it was the name of the strait that separated the island of Rozenburg from the sand bar of Welplaat. The strait itself was merely the continuation of the Nieuwe Maas, and the stretch of the river south of Rozenburg continued to be called Nieuwe Maas until the confluence with het Scheur formed the Brielse Maas estuary.Major waterway regulation works were carried out in the Netherlands in the 19th and 20th centuries to improve water management and stop the delta from silting up; the Botlek was dammed off at its southern end (connecting Rozenburg and Welplaat) and remodelled into one of the largest of the Rotterdam seaports (see also Europoort).

The canyon is shown in the IMAX film "North of Superior".The canyon was named after the former railway station of Ouimet, today an unincorporated place and railway point, located nearby on the Canadian Pacific Railway line. The station itself was named after the Canadian Minister of Public Works from 1892 to 1896, Joseph-Aldric Ouimet.Ouimet Canyon Provincial Park, a day-use park with no camping facilities, covers an area of around the canyon.The canyon is believed to have formed when a diabase sill dating from a billion years earlier was split open, either by the weight of advancing glaciers or the large volumes of water released during their retreat. Erosion by wind and rain continued the formation of the canyon. A large rock column known as the Indian Head can be seen from the northern viewing area.Near Ouimet Canyon is the privately owned and operated Eagle Canyon, which features on-site camping, two footbridges spanning the gorge and a zip line.The longer of the two footbridges is long and is suspended above the canyon floor. It claims to be Canada's longest foot suspension bridge. The zip line is claimed to be long and is advertised as Canada's longest, highest () and fastest ().

  <page name="Miami Valley">The Miami Valley is the land area surrounding the Great Miami River in southwest Ohio, USA, and includes the Little Miami, Mad, and Stillwater rivers as well. Geographically, it includes Dayton, Springfield, Middletown, Hamilton, and other communities. The name is derived from the Miami Indians.Commonly, however, it refers to the economic and cultural-social region centered on the Greater Dayton area. Middletown and Hamilton both fall under the economic and cultural-social influence of Cincinnati and thus are not commonly included in this sense. Institutions and enterprises in the Dayton area, such as Miami Valley Career Technology Center, Miami Valley Hospital, Miami Valley Council of the Boy Scouts of America and Miami Valley Storytellers illustrate local usage.During the mid-twentieth century, among the largest employers in the Valley were Procter and Gamble in Cincinnati, Champion Paper and Fiber in Hamilton, Armco in Middletown, and National Cash Register in Dayton.Local television stations WDTN, Think (WPTD and WPTO), WHIO-TV, WKEF and WRGT include the following counties and cities in the cultural Miami Valley:Additionally, WHIO includes the following locations in its news and weather coverage:As Greater Cincinnati grows northward through Butler County, it could conceivably merge with Greater Dayton by 2020, thereby virtually erasing any boundary between the two current Combined Statistical Areas (CSA). As a result, the US Census Bureau could begin reporting the Cincinnati and Dayton metropolitan areas as one by that time, though it would be up to the U.S. Office of Management and Budget to make the merger decision. The new Cincinnati–Dayton metropolitan area would be comparable in size to that of the Orlando–Deltona–Daytona Beach, FL CSA and place it within the top 20 most populous metros in the US, with a population of nearly 3.0 million.

  <page name="Magerøya">Magerøya () is a large island in Finnmark county, in the extreme northern part of Norway. The island lies along the Barents Sea in Nordkapp Municipality, just north of the Porsanger Peninsula. The mouth of Porsangerfjorden lies off the east coast of the island.Magerøya has an area of and the highest elevation on the island is above sea level. The most northern point on the island is also the northernmost point in Norway: Knivskjellodden. The island features a bleak, barren, tundra-covered landscape devoid of any trees (except for a few small pockets of mountain birch), with steep cliffs along the coast, and dramatic mountainscapes in the interior. On southern Magerøya, archaeologists have found evidence of settlements dating back 10,000 years.The main population centre on the island is the town of Honningsvåg. Other smaller places include the fishing villages of Gjesvær, Skarsvåg, Nordvågen, and Kamøyvær. North Cape is a very popular tourist attraction on the northern shore of the island.Magerøya's main claim to fame is the North Cape, a steep cliff cape on the northern coast that is a major tourist attraction. To accommodate the large amounts of tourists that visit the island, a subsea tunnel was built from 1993 to 1999. The North Cape Tunnel is part of the European route E69 highway and it is long and reaches a depth of below sea level. For a time, it was one of the longest and deepest subsea tunnels in the world. Fog or ice may occur inside the tunnel, even in summer.Norway's Hurtigruten ferry service stops at the town of Honningsvåg on Magerøya since the waters around the island remain ice-free all year round due to the warm North Atlantic drift. Honningsvåg Airport is located on the eastern part of the island.

  <page name="Rason">Rason (formerly Rajin-Sŏnbong; ) is a North Korean city and ice-free port in the Sea of Japan in the North Pacific Ocean on the northeast tip of North Korea. It is in the Kwanbuk region and location of the Rason Special Economic Zone.In South Korean pronunciation, the initial "R" of the name is pronounced as "N", (나선, "Naseon") as per standard Korean phonology. In 2000 the name was shortened from "Rajin-Sŏnbong" to "Rason". During the 1930s, the Japanese called it Rashin; at that time it was an important port at the end of a railroad line. It was liberated by the Red Army on 14 August 1945.Before 1991, Rason was used by the Soviet Union as an alternative warm water port in case Vladivostok was unavailable. From 1993 to 2004, it was administered separately from North Hamgyŏng as the Directly Governed City ("Chikhalsi") of Rason. Prior to 1993 and from 2004 to 2009, the city had been part of the North Hamgyŏng Province. Since 2010, the city is a "Special City", again breaking from provincial control but different to its older designation as a "Directly Governed City". It is unclear what this means in practice.Rason borders Jilin province of China and Khasansky District in Primorsky Krai of Russia. China is making investments in the port as it gives it access to the Sea of Japan. In July 2011, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) gave a green light to the China's domestic trade cargo to be shipped via its port of Rajin from northeast to east China.

  <page name="Médoc">The Médoc (; Gascon: "Medòc" ) is a region of France, well known as a wine growing region, located in the "département" of Gironde, on the left bank of the Gironde estuary, north of Bordeaux. Its name comes from "(Pagus) Medullicus", or "country of the "Medulli"", the local Celtic tribe. The region owes its economic success mainly to the production of red wine; it is home to around 1,500 vineyards.The area also has pine forests and long sandy beaches. The Médoc's geography is not ideal for wine growing, with its proximity to the Atlantic Ocean resulting in a comparatively mild climate and high rainfall making rot a constant problem. It is generally believed that the nature of the region's wine derives from the soil; although the terrain is flat, excellent drainage is a necessity and the increased amount of gravel in the soil allows heat to be retained, encouraging ripening, and extensive root systems.With the exception of Château Haut-Brion from Graves, all of the red wines in the 1855 Classification are from the Médoc. Many of the Médoc wines that are not in this classification were classified using the Cru Bourgeois system until 2007. Following legal challenges this category was abolished, and reintroduced in 2010 as an annual "mark of quality" depending on independent annual assessment.

  <page name="Yoxford">Yoxford is a village in the east of Suffolk, England close to the Heritage Coast, Minsmere Reserve (RSPB), Aldeburgh and Southwold.Some 94 miles from London and 25 miles north of Ipswich, Yoxford is surrounded by the parkland of three country houses in an area known as the “Garden of Suffolk”. The village derives its name from a ford of the River Yox where oxen could pass. It runs near the village. The junction of the A12 trunk road and the A1120 is in the village.The "Griffin Inn", a medieval Suffolk inn is located here. The Satis House Hotel, an 18th-century house, is often erroneously publicised as the inspiration for Charles Dickens in Great Expectations. However the Satis House of that book is better known to be based on Restoration House in Kent, referred to as 'satis' by Queen Elizabeth I. Yoxford's Satis House was actually named 'Yoxford House' until well after publication of the novel, as can quite clearly be seen on old Ordnance Survey maps. The Church of St Peter is situated here. On the edge of the village is Cockfield Hall the old home of the Blois family.The village is known for its antique shops and also has two pubs (The Griffin, andThe King's Head), a Post Office, a general store, a restaurant and other shops.
