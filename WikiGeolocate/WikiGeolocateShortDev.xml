  <page name="Genemuiden">Genemuiden is a city located in the north western part of the Province of Overijssel. It received city rights in 1275 which is also the first time Genemuiden gets mentioned in history.It stayed independent up until 2001 when, despite fierce opposition of its inhabitants, it was forced to merge with the smaller, neighbouring villages of Zwartsluis and Hasselt to form the municipality of Zwartewaterland.The town itself doesn't have any buildings over 150 years old as two fires destroyed the town completely in 1866. These fires could not be controlled due to the great number of hay stacks in one street, 'de Achterweg' or 'Nachtweg'. This street still holds a non smoking sign, which is unique for a street in Europe.Since the 18th century, the people from Genemuiden have been producing floor mats made of the bulrush that grows on the shores of the Zuiderzee. When the quality of the bulrush deteriorated in the 20th century, due to the change from salt water to fresh water (see Zuiderzee), the industry switched over to using coir imported from India to produce mats and carpets. In the sixties the first tufting machines were imported and currently Genemuiden is one of Europe's main production centres of tufted carpet and artificial grass.Genemuiden is a Protestant stronghold, having 5 reformed Protestant denominations and no Roman Catholic church. It's on the north-eastern tip of the so-called Dutch Bible Belt.

  <page name="Imperial Dam">The Imperial Diversion Dam (National ID # CA10159) is a concrete slab and buttress, ogee weir structure across the California/Arizona border, northeast of Yuma. Completed in 1938, the dam retains the waters of the Colorado River into the Imperial Reservoir before desilting and diversion into the All-American Canal, the Gila River, and the Yuma Project aqueduct. Between 1932 and 1940, the Imperial Irrigation District (IID) relied on the Inter-California Canal and the Imperial Canal and Alamo River.The Imperial Dam was built with three sections; the gates of each section hold back the water to help divert the water towards the desilting plant. Three giant desilting basins and seventy-two 770 ft (230 m) scrapers hold and desilt the water; the removed silt is carried away by six sludge-pipes running under the Colorado River that dump the sediment into the California sluiceway, which returns the silt to the Colorado River. The water is now directed back towards one of the three sections which divert the water into one of the three channels. About 90% of the volume of the Colorado River is diverted into the canals at this location. Diversions can top per second, roughly the volume of the Susquehanna River and more than 50 times the flow of the Rio Grande.The Gila River and the Yuma project aqueduct branch off towards Arizona while the All-American canal branches southwards for 37 miles (60 km) before reaching its headworks on the California border and bends west towards the Imperial Valley.

  <page name="Waterwheel Falls">Waterwheel Falls is a waterfall in the Sierra Nevada of California, located in Yosemite National Park. It is the largest of the many waterfalls of the Tuolumne River. Its upper part contains a series of small ledges, each of which creates a small plume as the water is deflected away from the rock face. An extraordinary phenomenon appears at the first and largest of these ledges during the high-water season of early summer. Strong gusts of wind can lift part of the spray and blow it back upward, causing it to reenter the falls above the ledge. This cyclic "waterwheel" gives the falls their name.

  <page name="Amundsen Gulf">Amundsen Gulf is a gulf located in Canadian Northwest Territories, between Banks Island and Victoria Island and the mainland. It is approximately in length and about across where it meets the Beaufort Sea.The Amundsen Gulf was explored by Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen between 1903 and 1906. The gulf is at the western end of the famous Northwest Passage, a route from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific.Few people live along the shores of the gulf, but there are a few towns and communities, including Sachs Harbour, Ulukhaktok, and Paulatuk. Heading north in the gulf one would find the Prince of Wales Strait. Heading southeast and east, the gulf leads through the Dolphin and Union Strait, past Simpson Bay and into the Coronation Gulf. From there one would go through the Dease Strait and into the Queen Maud Gulf, and eventually head northeast into the Victoria Strait. Heading west and northwest a traveller would first enter the Beaufort Sea and then the Arctic Ocean.The entire gulf is in the Arctic tundra climate region, characterized by extremely cold winters. In late winter the Amundsen Gulf is covered in sea ice. Most of the ice breaks up in July during a normal year, with some areas in the far eastern and northern part of the gulf only breaking up in August.Beluga whales, seals, Arctic char, cod, and even salmon use the waters of the gulf, salmon showing up for the first time off Sachs Harbour between 1999 and 2001.

  <page name="Downe">Downe is a village in Greater London within the London Borough of Bromley. It is also in the historic county of Kent.Downe is south west of Orpington and south east of Charing Cross. Downe lies on a hill, and much of the centre of the village is unchanged; the former village school now acts as the village hall. The word Downe originates from the Anglosaxon word "doon", latterly down, hence the South and North Downs. The village was part of Kent until April 1965 when it (and the remaining part of Orpington Urban District Council) was subsumed into the new London Borough of Bromley.When Charles Darwin moved there in 1842, the village was known as Down. Its name was changed later to Downe.Charles Darwin lived in Down House for 40 years, from 1842 until he died there in 1882. A favourite place of his was Downe Bank, now a nature reserve and Site of Special Scientific Interest, and several members of his family are buried in the graveyard of St Mary's Church.Down House and the surrounding area has been nominated by the Department of Culture, Media and Sport to become a World Heritage Site. However, this decision has been deferred.Downe is the location of Buckston Browne Farm, built in 1931 as a surgical research centre by the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS). In the 1980s, the farm caused controversy because of its use of vivisection techniques, and in August 1984 it was raided by anti-vivisection activists.The farm has now been made into four houses.There are two scout campsites in the Downe area:Despite being within Greater London, Downe has limited connections to the rest of the city. There are no rail links to the village, but it is served by two hourly bus routes:The nearest railway stations are:

To the south it is linked to the Solomon Sea by the Vitiaz Strait.It was the site of a major Japanese naval defeat in the Battle of the Bismarck Sea during World War II on 3 and 4 March 1943.The International Hydrographic Organization defines the Bismarck Sea as "that area of the South Pacific Ocean off the Northeast coast of New Guinea", with the following limits:"On the North and East." By the Northern and Northeastern coasts of the islands of New Ireland, New Hanover, the Admiralty Islands, Hermit Island, and the Ninigo Group, through Manu and Aua Islands to Wuvulu Island and thence a line to Baudissin Point in New Guinea (142°02'E)."On the Southeast." A line from the Southern point of New Ireland along the parallel of 4°50' South to the coast of New Britain, along its Northern coast and thence a line from its Western extreme through the Northern point of Umboi Island to Teliata Point, New Guinea"On the Southwest." By the Northeast coast of New Guinea.Recent explorations in the Bismarck Sea seabed have yielded discoveries of mineral-rich beds of sulfides, copper, zinc, silver and gold. These findings are especially important because they lie in shallow, calm waters. Papua New Guinea owns the mining rights to these minerals under international law.

Like other Bavarian lakes, Ammersee developed as a result of the ice age glaciers melting. Ammersee is fed by the River Ammer, which flows as the Amper out of the lake. Like neighbouring Lake Starnberg, which is similar in size and shape, it is a popular location for watersports.Ammersee and the Amper are part of the ancient Celtic amber trading route leading to the Brenner Pass.The word "Ammer" is a 13th-century form of "Amper", the Celtic "*ambra", deriving from the Indo-European "*ombh-, *mbh-" "wet, Water".Passenger services have operated on the lake since 1879. Today they are operated by the Bayerische Seenschifffahrt company, using a mixture of historic paddle steamers and motor ships.The lake's water generally has been of very good quality since a circular sewerage system was introduced in the 1960s collecting all wastewater from around the lake and transporting it to a treatment plant below the lake's outlet at Eching.The Ammersee abounds with fish and is the home of the vulnerable species of deepwater char "Salvelinus evasus". Deepwater char are highly sensitive to changes in the quality of the water and some species such as "Salvelinus neocomensis" and "Salvelinus profundus" were driven recently to extinction in other European lakes.

  <page name="Spring Point Ledge Light">Spring Point Ledge Light is a sparkplug lighthouse in South Portland, Maine that marks a dangerous obstruction on the west side of the main shipping channel into Portland Harbor. It is now adjacent to the campus of Southern Maine Community College.The lighthouse was constructed in 1897 by the government after seven steamship companies stated that many of their vessels ran aground on Spring Point Ledge. Congress initially allocated $20,000 to its construction, although the total cost of the tower ended up being $45,000 due to problems with storms and poor quality cement. The lighthouse featured a fog bell that sounded twice every 12 seconds, and a lantern fitted with a fifth order Fresnel lens first lit by Keeper William A. Lane on May 24, 1897.Improvements were made to the lighthouse throughout the 20th century. It was electrified in 1934, and in 1951, a 900-foot breakwater made from of granite was constructed in order to connect the lighthouse to the mainland. The lighthouse was originally owned and operated by the United States Coast Guard. However, on April 28, 1998, the Maine Lights Selection Committee approved a transfer of ownership of the tower to the Spring Point Ledge Light Trust, with the USCG retaining only the light and fog signal.

The modern Ordnance Survey uses only the name "Ouzel", except north of Willen Lake where it is marked as "River Ouzel or Lovat".From springs just north of Dagnall, the river initially forms the boundary between Bedfordshire and Buckinghamshire. It is joined by the Ouzel Brook from Houghton Regis, and by Whistle Brook (also known at Ivinghoe as "Whizzle Brook") from Pitstone. Near Grove Lock, just south of Leighton Buzzard, it was once joined by Ledburn Brook, which has since been diverted into the Grand Junction Canal (now the Grand Union Canal). At Leighton Buzzard, the river is joined by Clipstone Brook from Milton Bryan via Hockliffe and Clipstone, and to the north of the town the excess water from the canal is released into the river at the Twelve Arches.

  <page name="Dunboy Castle">Dunboy Castle is a ruined castle on the Beara Peninsula in south-west Ireland near the town of Castletownbere. It was a stronghold of the O'Sullivan Bere, a Gaelic clan leader and 'Chief of Dunboy', and was built to guard and defend the harbour of Berehaven. Its presence enabled O'Sullivan Bere to control the sea fisheries off the Irish coast and collect taxes from Irish and continental European fishing vessels sheltering in the haven. It was also a centre for the import/export trade to and from the continent. Today, much of the castle is destroyed but the ruins are open to the public.Dunboy Castle was the scene of the noted Siege of Dunboy in the summer of 1602 which ultimately led to its destruction and the breaking of the power of the O'Sullivan Bere. At that time Donal Cam O'Sullivan Bere was in rebellion against the English crown and Elizabeth I had sent a 5000-strong army under the command of Sir George Carew to suppress the insurgents. Even with its small garrison of 143 men Dunboy Castle was thought to be impregnable but following a fierce artillery bombardment the walls were smashed and after some desperate hand-to-hand fighting amid the rubble the defenders were finally overcome. The 58 survivors of the two-week siege were executed in the nearby market square.Near the castle ruins stands Puxley Mansion, a 19th-century manor house. It was burnt by the IRA in 1920 in reprisal for the destruction of houses that harboured IRA men and weapons by the Crown Forces. While some restoration work was completed in the 2000s, funding issues halted plans to refurbish the mansion and open it as a hotel.

Yet it retained the name "Rhine".The Kromme Rijn splits off the Nederrijn-Lek main artery at the old town of Wijk bij Duurstede (called Dorestad before medieval times), after which it twists and turns through the province of Utrecht, past the towns of Cothen, Werkhoven, Odijk and Bunnik, and ends in the moat of the city of Utrecht.Originally, the city of Utrecht was built by the Romans at a ford near the place where the Kromme Rijn forks into rivers Vecht (north) and Leidse Rijn (west); the last stretch within the city walls, however, was channelised to form the Oudegracht canal. Rivers Leidse Rijn and Vecht extend from the city moat and are the continuation of the Kromme Rijn.

Rinca is also populated with many other species such as wild pigs, buffalos and many birds.Being less known and less visited than Komodo, it is a good place to see the Komodo dragon in its natural environment with fewer people to disturb them. Day trips can be arranged from Labuan Bajo on Flores by small boat at the park headquarters.The island's area is .Living conditions for local people on the island are often difficult. Education facilities, for example, are quite limited for children. Some non-government organisations help with the provision of books for children on Rinca. Local people must also take some care to avoid Komodo dragons because Komodos in the area occasionally attack and kill humans.Rinca and Komodo bracket a north-south passage between the Indian Ocean and the Flores Sea. Due to the large bodies of water and narrow gap, the waters between Rinca and Komodo are subject to whirlpools and currents in excess of 10 knots.In June 2008, five scuba divers (three British, one French and one Swedish) were found on the Southern coast of Rinca after having been missing for 2 days. The group had drifted from where their dive boat abandoned them. They survived on oysters and other shellfish.

  <page name="Wrangell Narrows">The Wrangell Narrows is a winding, 35-km-long (22 mi) channel between Mitkof Island and Kupreanof Island in the Alexander Archipelago in Southeast Alaska. The Wrangell Narrows is one of the six Listed narrows in Southeast Alaska. There are about 60 lights and buoys to mark it because of its winding nature and navigation hazards. It was named "Proliv Vrangelya" (English: "Wrangell Strait") in 1838 by G. Lindenberg after Admiral Baron Ferdinand Petrovich von Wrangell. The translation "Wrangell Strait" remained in use while Wrangell Narrows referred to the narrowest central portion. By 1919 Department of Commerce nautical chart 8170 was changed from "Wrangell Strait" to Wrangell Narrows.The town of Petersburg is at the north end of the Narrows. The Narrows are created by Mitkof Island to the east and southeast, and the islands of Kuprenof and Woewodski to the north and west. The Narrows opens up to Frederick Sound to the north and Sumner Strait to the south.The channel is used by fishing boats and Alaska Marine Highway ferries. Very large ships (such as the largest cruise ships) do not use it because it is too shallow and narrow for them to pass safely. Because this is the only safe "Inside Passage" at this latitude, these larger ships must navigate in "outside" waters.

  <page name="Újpalota">Újpalota is a panel housing estate in the 15th district of Budapest, Hungary.In 1969 a new panel housing estate was founded on the northeastern border of Budapest, in a wheat field and a former cemetery, near the Szilas-patak (Szilas Brook), commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Hungarian Soviet Republic (1919). It was named "Újpalota" (literally means "Newcastle") after the adjacent village of Palota (means "Castle"), which initially became a suburb of the Hungarian capital, later part of Greater Budapest.104 panel buildings (5, 7, 11, 13 and 15-storey blocks) were planned to the area, including 14,105 flats with an average floor space of 52.6 m² (including one, two, three and four-bedroom apartements). According to Tibor Tenke, the architect of the housing estate, the original plan was modified, increasing the number of flats to 15,560. The buildings were built by the "BHK III." (3rd Housing Factory of Budapest, used Soviet-Hungarian technology), that finished the construction in 1978.In the late-1970s Újpalota had 60,000 inhabitants from all over the country, but mostly from the poor neighbourhoods of Budapest (Józsefváros, Kőbánya, Újpest, Kispest, Angyalföld), where their run-down houses were demolished. Újpalota provided these poor families with a real improvement in living conditions, including district heating, piped hot water and flush toilets. According to a 1975 survey, 70% of the householders were considered to be "worker", and only 12% passed the maturity exam ("érettségi vizsga" in Hungarian, a complex exam at the end of high school in Hungary). 21% of the pairs raised 1 child, 46% two children and 19% three children.According to the 2011 census, Újpalota had only 33,557 inhabitants, a significant decrease since the late-1970s.

  <page name="Ngonye Falls">The Ngonye Falls or Sioma Falls are a waterfall on the Zambezi river in Western Zambia, near the town of Sioma and a few hundred kilometers upstream from the Victoria Falls. Situated in the southern part of Barotseland, the falls are a difficult two- or three-day journey from the capital, Lusaka. Their inaccessibility makes them much less known than Victoria Falls. The surrounding area was converted into a national park in 2010/11.The falls are formed by the same geological process as Victoria Falls, with cracks in the basalt riverbed being eroded away to form the drop. Their height is only 10-25 meters, but the width of the falls is impressive. They form a broad crescent, interrupted by rocky outcrops.Upstream from the falls, the river is broad and shallow as it flows across Kalahari sands, but below the falls extensive white water rapids exist, as the river is hemmed in by gorges cut into basalt rock.The surrounding area supports extensive wildlife, especially in the nearby Sioma Ngwezi National Park, and elephants are frequently seen by the river in the vicinity of the falls.

Rome conquered the area in 15 BC, and made it part of the province of Rhaetia. The Province later became a county (countship) under Charlemagne. The county was repeatedly divided among heirs.The Lordship of Schellenberg was purchased by the Counts of Vaduz in 1437 and the two states have been united in fact ever since. After the Swabian War in 1499, both came under Austrian suzerainty. Different dynasties of counts bought and sold them, until their purchase in the early 18th century by the Liechtenstein dynasty, which had been granted princely status in 1706, but which needed to acquire a territory with imperial immediacy in order to vote in the Diet of the Princes of the Empire. The emperor formally united Vaduz and Schellenberg in 1719 as the Principality of Liechtenstein.In the municipality, there is a monument at the border town of Hinterschellenberg that commemorates the asylum given to Russian soldiers. At the close of World War II, Liechtenstein granted asylum to approximately five hundred soldiers of the First Russian National Army, a collaborationist Russian force within the German Wehrmacht. This act was no small matter as the country was poor and had difficulty feeding and caring for such a large group of refugees. Eventually, Argentina agreed to resettle the asylum seekers permanently. In contrast, the British repatriated the Russians who fought on the German side to the USSR.In Schellenberg, there is a small road crossing to Austria, manned by Austrian, Swiss border guards.

  <page name="Muir Glacier">Muir Glacier is a glacier in Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve in the U.S. state of Alaska. It is currently about wide at the terminus. As recently as the mid-1980s the glacier was a tidewater glacier and calved icebergs from a wall of ice 60 m (200 feet) tall.The glacier is named after Scottish-born naturalist John Muir, who traveled around the area and wrote about it, generating interest in the local environment and in its preservation. His first two visits were in 1879 (at age 41) and 1880. During the visits, he sent an account of his visits in installments to the "San Francisco Bulletin". Later, he collected and edited these installments in a book, "Travels in Alaska", published in 1915, the year after he died.Muir Glacier has undergone very rapid, well-documented retreat since its Little Ice Age maximum position at the mouth of Glacier Bay around 1780. Between 1941 and 2004 the glacier retreated more than twelve kilometers (seven miles) and thinned by over 800 meters (2625 feet). Ocean water has filled the valley replacing the ice.

  <page name="Colossus of Barletta">The Colossus of Barletta is a large bronze statue of an Eastern Roman Emperor, nearly three times life size (5.11 meters, or about 16 feet 7 inches) and currently located in Barletta, Italy.The statue reportedly washed up on a shore, after a Venetian ship sank returning from the sack of Constantinople in the Fourth Crusade in 1204, but it is not impossible that the statue was sent to the West much earlier. The identity of the Emperor is uncertain. According to tradition, it depicts Heraclius (reign 610–641 AD); though this is most unlikely on historical and art-historical grounds. More likely subjects are Theodosius II (reign 408–450 AD), who may have had it erected in Ravenna in 439, Honorius (reign 393–423 AD), Valentinian I (r. 364–375), Marcian (r. 450–457), Justinian I (r. 527–565) and especially Leo I the Thracian (r. 457–474).It is known that a colossal statue was discovered in 1231–1232 during excavations commissioned by Emperor Frederick II in Ravenna, and is not improbable that he had it transported to his southern Italian lands. The first certain news about the statue date however from 1309, when parts of its legs and arms were used by local Dominicans to cast bells. The missing parts were remade in the 15th century.The statue evidently depicts a bearded emperor, identifiable from his imperial diadem and his commanding gesture that invokes the act of delivering a speech, with his right arm raised, holding a cross. The Emperor wears a cuirass over his short tunic. His cloak is draped over his left arm in a portrait convention that goes back to Augustus. In his outstretched left hand he now holds an orb. His diademed head wears a Gothic jewel, similar to the one worn by Aelia Eudoxia, mother of Theodosius II.

  <page name="Canterbury Plains">The Canterbury Plains are an area in New Zealand centred to the south of the city of Christchurch in the Canterbury Region. Their northern extremes are at the foot of the Hundalee Hills in the Hurunui District, and in the south they merge into the plains of North Otago beyond the Waitaki River.The Canterbury Plains were formed from quaternary moraine gravels deposited during glacial periods in the late pleistocene approximately 3 million years to 10,000 years ago. The alluvial gravels were then reworked as shingle fans of several of the larger rivers, notably the Waimakariri, the Rakaia, the Selwyn, and the Rangitata. Part of the Canterbury-Otago tussock grasslands the land is suitable for moderately intensive livestock farming, but is prone to droughts, especially when the prevailing wind is from the northwest. At these times, the weather phenomenon known as the "Nor'west arch" can be seen across much of the plain.A major earthquake on 4 September 2010 revealed a previously unknown geological fault beneath the Canterbury Plains and created a surface rift that offset features by as much as four meters in places.The rivers of the Canterbury Plains have a distinctive braided appearance, which differentiates this area from the plains of North Otago to the south - beyond the Waitaki, the rivers typically have narrower, well-formed channels, rather than spreading across wide shingle depressions, as in Canterbury.Most of the population of Canterbury lives in a series of large and small towns arranged northeast to southwest along the plains, connected by State Highway 1 and the Main South railway line. These include Christchurch, Ashburton and Timaru, and the smaller Kaiapoi, Dunsandel, Rakaia, Temuka, and Glenavy. Other towns on the plains include Rangiora, Leeston, Lincoln, Darfield, Geraldine, Methven and Waimate.The extremely rare weevil "Hadramphus tuberculatus" is endemic to the plains.

  <page name="South Mimms">South Mimms, sometimes spelt South Mymms, is a village and civil parish forming part of the Hertsmere district of Hertfordshire in the East of England. It is a small settlement located near to the junction of the M25 motorway with the A1(M) motorway and is perhaps more widely known because of the naming of the service station at that junction.Potters Bar was originally a small settlement in the parish of South Mimms. Potters Bar became the location of the nearest railway station and eventually became much larger. Both Potters Bar and South Mimms were part of Middlesex until the creation of Greater London, which abolished the county of Middlesex in 1965. South Mimms was the northernmost village in Middlesex.South Mimms parish was split in 1894 under the Local Government Act 1894 with the extreme southern tip forming South Mimms Urban parish in the Barnet Urban District and was transferred to Hertfordshire. This area now forms part of the London Borough of Barnet. The rest of the parish became the South Mimms Rural District, later renamed the Potters Bar Urban District.South Mimms served as a home for Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands during her exile in World War II. A German air attack on South Mimms at this time narrowly missed her, killing two of her guards, an incident mentioned in her autobiography.Dancers Hill in South Mimms was the location of a World War II prisoner-of-war camp, Camp 33, that consisted of two compounds, both providing tented accommodation for prisoners.Richmond Thackeray, father of William Makepeace Thackeray, was born in the parish and baptised in the church in 1781.For many years Clare Hall Hospital was used as a tuberculosis sanatorium. It is now used by Cancer Research UK.A notable person born in South Mimms is Samuel Tinsley, a famous chess player.

  <page name="Lesser Slave Lake">Lesser Slave Lake is located in central Alberta, Canada, northwest of Edmonton. It is the second largest lake entirely within Alberta boundaries (and the largest easily accessible by vehicle), covering and measuring over long and at its widest point. Lesser Slave Lake averages in depth and is at its deepest. It drains eastwards into the Athabasca River by way of the Lesser Slave River.The town of Slave Lake is located at the eastern tip of the lake, around the outflow of Lesser Slave River.Due to its location on a major fly-way for migrating birds, Lesser Slave Lake is popular with birders. The nearby Lesser Slave Lake Provincial Park has lakeside camping facilities located along sand beaches, with some rocky beaches as well. Fishing is popular and legal. The entire north shore of the lake is protected, other reserves being Hilliard's Bay Provincial Park, "Lesser Slave Lake Wildland" and "Grouard Trail Park Reserve".Highway 2 and the Canadian National Railway follow the southern shore of the lake, and the Bicentennial Highway has its southernmost point at eastern end of the lake.A number of Indian reserves are established at the shores of the lake:On February 14, 1968, a Cessna 182H CF-WUK plane crashed into the lake due to ice forming on the wings and causing the pilot to lose control. The pilot was a Graham James Cox, a former 501 Squadron Commander during World War 2. Both he and his two passengers died in the accident. The passengers were William Henry Lucus and Kenneth McIntosh McMillan.On May 20, 2011, a Bell 212 helicopter crashed into the lake while fighting the 2011 Slave Lake fire. The pilot, 54-year-old Jean-Luc Deba of Montreal, died. On the one-year anniversary, a park at Canyon Creek was named in Deba's honor.

  <page name="Aguasabon River">The Aguasabon River is a river in Thunder Bay District, Ontario, Canada. The river originates at Chorus Lake and empties into Lake Superior near the community of Terrace Bay.The Aguasabon is in length, and plunges down at the Aguasabon Falls. The river follows fractures in the 2.6 billion-year-old bedrock, and the exposed rock is granodiorite.Aguasabon Station is a dam and two unit hydroelectric power plant run by Ontario Power Generation. It generates power to support a Kimberly-Clark pulp and paper plant at Terrace Bay.In 1945, the Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario began preliminary survey work for a planned hydroelectric facility in the Terrace Bay area. Construction commenced in 1946 and the facility began operating in 1948. The development required five million hours of labour, a network of access roads, and the erection of 25 buildings including staff housing, a hospital, administration office, pump house, machine shops and laundry. The dam enlarged Hays Lake to five hundred times its original size, and forced the relocation of Ontario Highway 17, requiring a new bridge be constructed. As part of the project, the Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario diverted the headwaters of the Kenogami River to flow south into Long Lake and into the Aguasabon River system to Lake Superior, rather than flowing north towards Hudson Bay via the Albany River.

  <page name="Fangliao">Fangliao Township is a rural township in Pingtung County, Taiwan Province of the Republic of China.In 1867, the village of "Pangliau" was located at the shore of a bay. American consul Charles Le Gendre, reporting on his 1867 visit to southern Formosa (see Formosa Expedition), wrote: "The products are rice and peanuts. Women pound the rice and till the fields, while the men are entirely taken up with fishing." The high mountains to the east were the "exclusive domain of the savage aborigines, who receive from the Chinese (or half-caste) population a certain share of their crops".In 1875, Imperial commissioner Shen Baozhen, who had been charged with making arrangements to prevent the Japanese from occupying Chinese districts, began introducing reforms in government.

  <page name="Belair railway station">Belair railway station is located on the Adelaide to Melbourne line in the Adelaide southern foothills suburb of Belair, 21.5 kilometres from Adelaide station. It is the terminus for Adelaide Metro's Belair line service.Belair station opened in 1883 with the opening of the Adelaide to Aldgate section of the Adelaide-Melbourne line.Belair is a scenic location on the edge of the Belair National Park and the station has a number of historic preserved buildings. In past years, many people travelled by train to Belair at weekends to enjoy the adjacent National Park. The large 1890s vintage wooden shelter on the main platform was built for these crowds. There were other facilities at the station such as a refreshment room, now long gone. Parts of the heritage station were destroyed by an arsonist in May 2003. The building is currently being rebuilt with special materials. There are also a number of stabling sidings for storing passenger trains overnight.Until 1987, the Bridgewater line carried suburban trains further into the Adelaide Hills as far as the town of Bridgewater. The Bridgewater trains were withdrawn in 1987, attributed to high cost of operation and low passenger numbers. Platform 2 was used to terminate some suburban trains for a while after the closure of the line. Stations beyond Belair were closed and all suburban trains now terminate at Belair.In 1995, the Adelaide to Melbourne line was converted to standard gauge. This prevented any restoration of local trains to Bridgewater or beyond. Between Adelaide and Belair, the former double track route became two parallel single lines, one broad gauge for Adelaide Metro services, and the former Adelaide bound track was converted to standard gauge for interstate freight.

  <page name="Long Range Mountains">The Long Range Mountains are a series of mountains along the west coast of the Canadian island of Newfoundland. They also form the northernmost section of the Appalachian chain on the eastern seaboard of North America. In 2003 it was announced that the International Appalachian Trail would be extended through the Long Range Mountains.During the Precambrian, around 1,200 million years ago, the ancient core of what is now eastern North America collided slowly with another continent to form a vast mountain range. All that remains today are the deeply eroded granites and gneisses of the Long Range mountains.In the Precambrian, the supercontinent began to break apart. As it split, steep fractures formed and filled with molten rock from below. This magma cooled into the diabase dykes seen in the cliffs of Western Brook Pond and Ten Mile Pond.By 570 million years ago the continent finally rifted apart, and the resulting basin became an ocean called the Iapetus Ocean. Some of the rocks of Gros Morne National Park were part of the continental margin on the western side of this new ocean, south of the Equator.Running along the Gulf of St. Lawrence, the range includes the following sections:

  <page name="San Giorgio Maggiore">San Giorgio Maggiore is one of the islands of Venice, northern Italy, lying east of the Giudecca and south of the main island group.The isle is surrounded by "Canale della Grazia", "Canale della Giudecca", "Saint Mark Basin", "Canale di San Marco" and the southern lagoon. It forms part of the San Marco sestiere.San Giorgio Maggiore was probably occupied in the Roman period; after the foundation of Venice it was called "Insula Memmia" after the Memmo family who owned it. By 829 it had a church consecrated to St George; thus it was designated as "San Giorgio Maggiore" to be distinguished from San Giorgio in Alga.The San Giorgio Monastery was established in 982, when the Benedictine monk, Giovanni Morosini, asked the doge Tribuno Memmo to donate the whole island for a monastery. Morosini drained the island's marshes next to the church to get the ground for building, and founded the Monastery of San Giorgio Maggiore, and became its first abbot.San Giorgio is now best known for the Church of San Giorgio Maggiore, designed by Palladio and begun in 1566.The belltower has a ring of 9 bells in C#.In the early 19th century, after the Republic fell, the monastery was almost suppressed and the island became a free port with a new harbour built in 1812. It became the home of Venice's artillery.San Giorgio Maggiore is now the headquarters of the Cini Foundation arts centre, known for its library and is also home to the Teatro Verde open-air theatre. In addition, it features two harbours managed by the Compagnia della Vela: Darsena Crose, facing north (see second image below) and Darsena Verde, facing south.

  <page name="Borgerhout">Borgerhout is a district in the city of Antwerp in the Flemish Region of Belgium. The district houses 41,614 inhabitants (as of 31 May 2006) reflecting 90 nationalities. It is divided in two by three adjoining traffic arteries (the "Ring" highway, the "Singel" boulevard, and the main railway Brussels-Amsterdam).The "Ring" highway surrounding Antwerp follows the line of the old city walls which is why the portion of Borgerhout 'within' the ring highway is known as Borgerhout 'intra muros' (within the walls) whereas the portion outside the ring highway is known as Borgerhout 'extra muros' (outside the walls). Population density is lower in the more recently developed 'extra muros' part of the town. The 'inter muros' part of the town is more densely populated and also contains the main shopping street.Local references to this part of the town as "Borgerokko" are believed to derive from the higher proportion of residents from North Africa, many being of Moroccan descent. In 2002, there were widespread riots in Borgerhout after a white Belgian man murdered Mohammed Achrak, an Islamic religious affairs teacher of Moroccan origin. Racial tensions have been brewing in Antwerp—where one in three voters supports the far-right anti-immigration Vlaams Belang—for years. In 2011, a smaller riot occurred in the neighborhood after the Moroccan soccer team defeated the Algerian team 4-0. Many residents, however, feel the news coverage of these events has been overblown because of fears of ethnic minorities.

  <page name="Spina">Spina was an Etruscan port city, established by the end of the 6th century BCE, on the Adriatic at the ancient mouth of the Po, south of the lagoon which would become the site of Venice. The site of Spina was lost until modern times, when drainage schemes in the delta of the Po River in 1922 first officially revealed a necropolis of Etruscan Spina about four miles west of the commune of Comacchio. The fishermen of Comacchio, it soon turned out, had been the source of "Etruscan" vases (actually originally imported from Greece) and other artifacts that had appeared for years on the archeological black market. The archaeological finds from the burials of Spina were discovered with the help of aerial photography. Aside from the white reflective surfaces of the modern drainage channels there appeared in the photographs a ghostly network of dark lines and light rectangles, the former indicating richer vegetation on the sites of ancient canals. Thus the layout of the ancient trading port was revealed, now miles from the sea, due to the sedimentation of the Po delta. Spina may have had a Hellenised indigenous population.&lt;br&gt;

It is within the Sololá Department, northern Guatemala.The volcano has been quite active historically, with more than a dozen eruptions recorded between 1469 and 1853, the date of its most recent eruption. Atitlán is part of the Central American Volcanic Arc. The arc is a chain of volcanoes stretching along Central America formed by subduction of the Cocos Plate underneath the Caribbean Plate. These volcanoes are part of the Ring of Fire around the Pacific Ocean.Volcán Atitlán is few miles south of Volcán Tolimán, which rises from the southern shore of Lake Atitlán. Volcán San Pedro rises above Lake Atitlán northwest of Volcán Atitlán. A long narrow bay separates Volcán Atitlán and Volcán Toliman from Volcán San Pedro.Atitlán is home to two particularly rare and beautiful birds that are endemic to the cloud forests of this region. The horned guan ("Oreophasis derbianus") is a Pleistocene relic of the Cracidae family that persists today only in small fragments of its previous range. Its habitat is limited to cloud forests above approximately . This bird is the size of a turkey and the adult male has a one-inch scarlet-colored "horn" projecting straight up from the top of its head. The Cabanis's or azure-rumped tanager ("Tangara cabanisi") is probably the most restricted-range species in the region. It occurs only at mid-elevations within the Sierra Madre del Sur of Chiapas, Mexico and western Guatemala.

It is known for the Fortress Or Qapi that served as the gateway to Crimea. The village currently is part of Armyansk Municipality. Population:The original name was of the Greek settlement of "Taphros" which means a dug-out locality. Thereafter was the equivalent name of "Or Qapı" in the Crimean Tatar language meaning "Or" - trench and "Qapı" - gate, and subsequently the name "Perekop" in the Slavic languages which literally means an over-dug locality.Due to its key position, over the history Perekop was under many sieges.During the Russo-Turkish War (1735–1739), Russian Field Marshal Burkhard Christoph von Munnich successfully stormed the fortifications on June 17, 1736 and left the Tatar fortress in ruins. This was a serious, if not mortal, blow to the independence of the Crimean Khanate.The town was virtually wiped out during the Siege of Perekop by the Red Army in 1920. The siege was a key episode of the Russian Civil War. The success of the Bolsheviks allowed them to oust Pyotr Wrangel's White Army from the Crimea. Twelve years later, the Soviets founded the new town of Krasnoperekopsk to the south.During World War II, Perekop was occupied by the German Army from September 27, 1941 to November 1, 1943. The capture of Perekop (by both the Wehrmacht in 1941 and the Red Army in 1943) was used to cut off Crimea from the rest of Ukraine.

  <page name="Chiemsee">Chiemsee is a freshwater lake in Bavaria, Germany, near Rosenheim. It is often called "the Bavarian Sea". The rivers Tiroler Achen and Prien flow into the lake from the South; the river Alz, out towards the north. The Alz flows into the Inn which then merges with the Danube. The Chiemsee is divided into the bigger, north section, in the northeast, called "Weitsee", and the "Inselsee", in the southwest.The region around the Chiemsee is Chiemgau and is a famous recreation area.The Chiemsee was formed, like many other pre-alpine lakes, at the end of the last ice age about 10,000 years ago from a hollow carved out by a glacier (a "Zungenbecken"). Originally the lake covered an area of almost 240 km², which is about three times its present area. Within 10,000 years its area shrank to around 80 km². Before 1904 the water level was lowered by about a metre. As a result, large areas of dry land were reclaimed.There are three main islands on the lake: Herreninsel, the largest, with an area of 238 ha; Frauenchiemsee, 15.5 ha, also called "Herreninsel" ("gentlemen’s island") and "Fraueninsel" ("ladies’ island"); and uninhabited Krautinsel, 3.5 ha. It is known as "cabbage island" because in the Middle Ages it was cultivated with vegetable and cabbages.There are also three very small islands: the "Schalch", to the west of Frauenchiemsee; and two unnamed islands, 54 and 80 meters south of the "Krautinsel", with an area of 30 m² each.

It is connected by a highway and a rail connection on the MTR Disneyland Resort Line to Sunny Bay Station. Most of its area is administrated by Tsuen Wan District, but its south little part is administrated by Islands District.At least in Ming Dynasty( A.D 1368-A.D. 1644), Penny' Bay was already a trading port.Before the reclamation of the bay, Cheoy Lee Shipyard operated in the bay from 1964 to April 2001. The Government acquired the land from the owners for the sum of HK$1.48 billion, and paid HK$22.7 million in additional compensation, according to a Public Works Subcommittee paper from May 2002.The Government had not realised that its operations accumulated 30000 cubic metres of soil contaminated with dioxin, heavy metals, and hydrocarbons. The solid waste was dug up and transferred to To Kau Wan on the north shore of Northeast Lantau for temporary processing, and finally incinerated at the Chemical Waste Treatment Centre on the Tsing Yi Island amid protests by residents. The total cleanup cost not taken into account at the time of acquisition was estimated at 450 million Hong Kong dollars.

  <page name="Waianae Range">Waianae Range (sometimes referred to as the "Waianae Mountains") is the eroded remains of an ancient shield volcano that comprises the western half of the Hawaiian Island of Oahu. Its crest, at Kaʻala, is the highest peak on Oahu at .Like the neighboring Koolau, the Waianae Range is not a mountain range in the sense most people are familiar with, as the mountain range as a whole was created from a single volcano.The oldest lava dated from the volcano are about 3.9 million years old. About 3.2 million years ago, the volcano's activity changed, the rate of eruption started to decrease and the composition of the lava erupted from the volcano changed. The volcano is thought to have last erupted about 2.5 million years ago.When active, the Waianae volcano's center of activity was at present-day Lualualei Valley. Intense erosion on the western flank of the mountain has destroyed much of those flanks. Thus, the mountain today is much smaller than it was when the volcano was active.While the western part of the mountain has been destroyed by erosion, the eastern part is still in a youthful stage of erosion. This is considered somewhat strange by some geologists since the western part of the volcano is on the leeward side of the island; thus, most rain falls on the eastern side of the volcano. Given this information, more erosion would be expected on the eastern portion of the mountain. One theory to explain this erosion pattern is that a large landslide cut away the western portion of the volcano. The faults from this huge landslide weakened the rock, making the western part of the mountain much more susceptible to erosion than the eastern side.

  <page name="Consolidated Mine">The Consolidated Mine was a gold mine in Lumpkin County, Georgia, United States, just east of Dahlonega. Like most of the area around Dahlonega, the placer mining on the land on which the mine is located probably started during the Georgia Gold Rush. By 1880, the placer deposits were exhausted and the land was down to hard rock. Gold was soon discovered in a huge quartz vein system, and mined. "The richest acre" was mined deep into the ground - and the resulting shaft became known as the "Glory Hole.”After an interruption of operations at the mine, a group of investors purchased about 7,000 acres (28 km²) of land around the discovery sight and formed the Dahlonega Consolidated Gold Mining Co. in 1895. After constructing the largest stamp mill east of the Mississippi River at the Consolidated Mine property, the Mining Co. folded in 1906. The mine's lower workings became flooded and lay dormant until seventy-five years later, when the site came under new ownership.There is still gold to be mined here - but the cost of extracting the gold from the mine exceeds the value of the gold, at least for the time being. Today, a part of the upper level of the mine remains open for tourists, who can tour portions of the “Glory Hole” underground and pan for gold. Original cart rails, electrical lines and even an operational pneumatic drill recovered from the mine may be viewed. This mine and Crisson Mine are the two mines in the Dahlonega area that remain open for tourists. The Consolidated Mine remains the only mine in the area safe enough to take tourists into.

  <page name="Angoche">Angoche is a city of Nampula Province in Mozambique. The city was named "António Enes" until 1976, after the 19th-century Portuguese journalist and colonial administrator, António José Enes. In administrative terms, since 1998, the city is also a municipality.Angoche is an old Muslim trading centre, which local tradition states was founded in the 1490s by refugees from the Kilwa Sultanate. Xosa, the son of one of the leaders of the refugees, was made the first sultan. One of the earliest settlements in Mozambique and an important gold and ivory trading post, it posed a serious rival to the Portuguese settlement in Mozambigue until the mid-16th century, when Angoche was eclipsed by Quelimane as an entry port to the interior. However, Angoche continued to play a role in coastal trade and was an important economic and political centre in the region, with close ties to Ilha de Moçambique. In the 19th century, Angoche became the focus of the clandestine slave trade, which continued until the 1860s when the town was attacked by the Portuguese. While effective Portuguese administration was not established until several decades later, the attack marked the beginning of Angoche's downfall, and the town never regained its former status.Today, Angoche is a quiet, somewhat dilapidated district capital with few reminders of its past. Several islands lie offshore from the town. The major language of Angoche and nearby Koti Island is Ekoti, a Makhuwa language borrowing from 15th century Swahili.

  <page name="Taedong River">The Taedong River (Chosŏn'gŭl: ) is a large river in North Korea. It rises in the Rangrim Mountains of the country's north. It then flows southwest into Korea Bay at Namp'o. In between, it runs through the country's capital, Pyongyang. Along the river are landmarks such as the Juche Tower and Kim Il-sung Square.The river has a length of 439 kilometers and is generally deep. It is the fifth longest river on the Korean peninsula and the second longest in North Korea. Pyongyang is approximately 110 km upstream from the mouth, Sunchon 192 km upstream, and Taehŭng 414 km upstream. Because of its depth, it is widely used for river transport; it is navigable by large ships up to 65 km inland, though most commercial traffic stops at Songrim.The kingdom of Koguryo was founded on its shores. Many archeological sites dating to the neolithic and Bronze ages have been found along the river, as well as relics and ruins from Koguryo. It was also once known as the Pae River.In 1986, the government completed the 8 kilometer long West Sea Barrage, with three locks and 36 sluices, at the mouth of the Taedong River near Namp'o. The dam acts to control floodwater and to irrigate lands newly reclaimed from the Korea Gulf. The dam has reduced the river's natural ability to purify itself and tends to concentrate contaminants. Other dams, such as the Nyongwon Power Station, have been built to provide energy to the country.In Pyongyang, there are six bridges on the Taedong, including the Okryu Bridge, Rungra Bridge, and Taedong Bridge.

  <page name="Acklins">Acklins is an island and district of the Bahamas.It is one of a group of islands arranged along a large, shallow lagoon called the Bight of Acklins, of which the largest are Crooked Island (76 sq mi) in the north and Acklins (120 sq mi) in the southeast, and the smaller are Long Cay (once known as Fortune Island, 8 sq mi) in the northwest, and Castle Island in the south.The islands were settled by American Loyalists in the late 1780s who set up cotton plantations employing over 1,000 slaves. After the abolition of slavery in the British Empire these became uneconomical, and the replacement income from sponge diving has now dwindled as well with the rest of the natural sponge industry after the advent of synthetics. The inhabitants now live by fishing and small-scale farming.Although Acklins Island has relatively few historical landmarks, there are some noteworthy places. Acklins is home to numerous Lucayan people sites. An ancient Lucayan Indian site, thought to be one of the largest Lucayan Indian settlements in The Bahamas, sits along Pompey Bay Beach, just south of Spring Point. Ten ancient Lucayan sites have been unearthed by National Geographic Society Archeologists in Samana Cay alone, which is northeast of Spring Point in Acklins.Plana Cays, also northeast of Spring Point, is a protected reserve for endangered great iguanas and the very rare estimated hutias (guinea pig like rodents), the only native mammal of The Bahamas. Another site of interest is the remote Castle Island Lighthouse at the southernmost point of Acklins Island.The population of Acklins was 565 at the 2010 census, with the most people living in Lovely Bay in the northwestern tip of the island and in Salina Point in the southernmost area of the island.The island is served by Spring Point Airport.

  <page name="Pindamonhangaba">Pindamonhangaba is a municipality in the state of São Paulo, Brazil, located in the Paraíba valley, between the two most active production and consumption regions in the country, São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. It is accessible by the Via Dutra (BR-116 – SP-60 highway) at the 99th km. This place name comes from the Old Tupi language meaning "where hooks are made" or, according to a different interpretation, "where the river bends".Source: IBGEThe region then occupied by the Portuguese was Pindamonhangaba at least since July 22, 1643, registering more remote occupation by a certain Captain João Prado Martins. Six years later, on May 17, 1649, the area was formalized as a land grant and donated to the captain. It seems there is no information about what occurred between that date and August 12, 1672, so 13 years later, a chapel was built in honor of São José by brothers Antônio Bicudo Leme and Braz Esteves Leme. The brothers Leme have acquired of the Countess of Vimieiro (Condesa de Vimieiro), the lands north of the town of Taubaté. There is no news of how the allotment had passed from the hands of Captain Prado Martins to the Countess of Vimieiro. Given the uncertainties of history, two recent mayors of the city solved the problem by fiat: Caio Gomes Mayor officiated at the date of August 12, 1672 (Leme brothers) as the founding date of the city and later, Mayor João Bosco Nogueira decreed magna that date the county was founded was the date of emancipation, July 10, 1705.

Much of its housing stock dates from the early 20th century. Several well-known African-American architects, including W. Sidney Pittman and Howard D. Woodson, and many skilled local craftsmen designed and built many of its homes. The neighborhood was once home to Nannie Helen Burroughs, an early civil rights leader and the founder of the National Training School for Women and Girls, an independent boarding school for African-American girls founded in 1909 and located on 50th Street, NE. Marvin Gaye (1939–1984) was also born and raised in this neighborhood. From 1921 to 1940, Deanwood was also home to Suburban Gardens (50th and Hayes NE), a black-owned amusement park that served thousands of African-American residents during a time of racial segregation.It is served by the Deanwood Metro station on the Orange Line.The neighborhood is featured prominently in crime author Jim Beane's short story, "Jeanette."Metro StationsMajor Bus Routes

  <page name="Biritiba-Mirim">Biritiba-Mirim is a Brazilian municipality of the state of São Paulo. It is part of the Metropolitan Region of São Paulo. The population is 31,158 (2015 est.) in an area of 317.41 km². Its limits are Guararema in the north, Salesópolis in the east, Bertioga to the south and Mogi das Cruzes in the west and northwest.In late 2005, Biritiba-Mirim Mayor Roberto Pereira da Silva put forth a proposal to the town council that the city should enact a prohibition on the death of its human residents. This proposal, obviously a bit hard to enforce, is a sort of satirical protest in response to a national law prohibiting the expansion of cemetery space or the creation of new cemetery space in certain areas deemed environmentally sensitive or significant. This law has put a hardship on the town whose cemetery space had been recently exhausted but where people continue to die.Sitting atop the underground water source for approximately 2 million people in the city of São Paulo and being partially composed of protected forest land, Biritiba-Mirim has fallen under the national restrictions on new cemetery space and has thus had to resort to drastic measures in order to cope with the lack of space for the burial of their dead, including the requiring of the sharing of crypts and the burying of bodies under sidewalks.Biritiba-Mirim is not the only town to be affected by the environmental restrictions either. Dozens of other towns in the surrounding area have faced similar difficulties. Officials for Biritiba-Mirim are hoping that exceptions approved by environmentalists can be made.
